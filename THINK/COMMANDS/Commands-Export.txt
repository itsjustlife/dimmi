### **Commands-Export.txt**

#### **EXPORT Command**
**Default confidence_threshold:** 0.8
**Purpose**: Convert and export Arkhive content into user-specified formats for external use or sharing. Ensures compatibility with various tools like OPML (SimpleMind), JSON, and plain text.

---

#### **Core Functionalities**

1. **Export to Plain Text**
   - **Goal**: Output a simplified text-based version of the Arkhive.  
   - **Syntax**: `EXPORT TEXT [Category/Arkhive]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Category: Artificial Intelligence
     - Subcategory: Machine Learning
     - Subcategory: Neural Networks
     ```

2. **Export to JSON**
   - **Goal**: Create a structured JSON file suitable for API integration or further processing.  
   - **Syntax**: `EXPORT JSON [Category/Arkhive]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```json
     {
       "Category": "Artificial Intelligence",
       "Subcategories": [
         "Machine Learning",
         "Neural Networks"
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Export to OPML (for SimpleMind)**
   - **Goal**: Export Arkhive content into an OPML file for import into mind-mapping tools like SimpleMind.  
   - **Syntax**: `EXPORT OPML [Category/Arkhive]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```xml
     <opml version="2.0">
       <head>
         <title>Artificial Intelligence</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <outline text="Artificial Intelligence">
           <outline text="Machine Learning" />
           <outline text="Neural Networks" />
         </outline>
       </body>
     </opml>
     ```

#### **Steps to Export to OPML for SimpleMind**

1. **Command Execution**  
   - Use the syntax: `EXPORT OPML [Category/Arkhive]`.
   - Example Command:  
     ```
     EXPORT OPML "Technology"
     ```

2. **Generated Output**  
   - The system generates an OPML file like the following:  
     ```xml
     <opml version="2.0">
       <head>
         <title>Technology</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <outline text="Technology">
           <outline text="Artificial Intelligence">
             <outline text="Machine Learning" />
             <outline text="Neural Networks" />
           </outline>
           <outline text="Quantum Computing" />
         </outline>
       </body>
     </opml>
     ```

3. **Save the File**  
   - Save the output with the `.opml` extension (e.g., `Technology.opml`).

4. **Import into SimpleMind**  
   - Open SimpleMind.
   - Navigate to **File > Import > OPML**.
   - Select the exported `.opml` file.
   - The Arkhive structure will appear as a mind map with the categories and subcategories as nodes.

#### **New Subcommands**

1. **EXPORT CUSTOM TEMPLATE**
   - **Purpose**: Export data using user-defined templates.  
   - **Syntax**: `EXPORT CUSTOM [Template] [Category/Arkhive]`  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     EXPORT CUSTOM "MyTemplate" "Artificial Intelligence"
     Output:
     - Generated file format and structure based on "MyTemplate."
     ```

2. **EXPORT TRACEBACK**
   - **Purpose**: Include a history of changes made to the exported content.  
   - **Syntax**: `EXPORT TRACEBACK [Category/Arkhive]`  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     EXPORT TRACEBACK "AI Ethics"
     Output:
     - AI Ethics content with appended version history.
     ```

---

#### **Advanced Features**

1. **Multi-Format Export**
   - Combine multiple formats in a single command.  
   - Syntax: `EXPORT MULTI [Formats] [Category/Arkhive]`  
   - Example:  
     ```
     EXPORT MULTI TEXT, JSON, OPML "Healthcare"
     ```

2. **Selective Export**
   - Export specific levels or subcategories.  
   - Syntax: `EXPORT SELECTIVE [Category] [Levels]`  
   - Example:  
     ```
     EXPORT SELECTIVE "Artificial Intelligence" 2
     ```

3. **Batch Export**
   - Export multiple categories or Arkhives simultaneously.  
   - Syntax: `EXPORT BATCH [Category1, Category2, ...]`  
   - Example:  
     ```
     EXPORT BATCH "Technology", "Healthcare"
     ```

---

#### **Usage Scenarios**

1. **Exporting an Arkhive for Presentation**
   ```
   Command: EXPORT OPML "Healthcare"
   Process:
   - Generated OPML file for use in SimpleMind.
   - Imported into SimpleMind as a mind map.
   ```

2. **Creating API-Compatible JSON**
   ```
   Command: EXPORT JSON "AI Ethics"
   Output:
   {
     "Category": "AI Ethics",
     "Subcategories": [
       "Bias in AI",
       "Regulatory Compliance"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Including Change History in Export**
   ```
   Command: EXPORT TRACEBACK "Technology"
   Output:
   - File with content and appended version history.
   ```

Create: Outline
Purpose:
When the AI is asked to create an outline, it should produce a simple, easy-to-read outline that presents a clear hierarchy of topics and subtopics. This format is for human readability and not intended to be used in a tool like SimpleMind Pro.

Format:

Use bullet points or numbered lists to represent hierarchical levels.
Indent subcategories under their parent categories.
Do not use OPML or XML code for this format.
Example of Create: Outline:
plaintext
Copy code
Arkhive WHO Section:

1. Individuals
    - People and Societies
        - Notable Figures
            - Leaders, Pioneers, Historical Figures
        - Biographies
Instructions:

Top-level items: Represent main topics (e.g., "Individuals").
Subcategories: Indent the subtopics beneath the parent topic.
Further subcategories: Continue indenting further subcategories as necessary.
The structure should be clear and easily understandable by humans, without code syntax.
Create: Outline Code
Purpose:
When the AI is asked to create outline code, it should produce OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) code that can be imported into tools like SimpleMind Pro. This format is intended for precise, machine-readable structures, following strict XML formatting rules.

OPML Breakdown and Explanation:
XML Declaration: Specifies the version of XML.
Example: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
Head Section: Contains meta-information like the title of the outline.
Example: <head><title>Arkhive WHO Section</title></head>
Body Section: Contains the hierarchical structure of the outline.
Example: <body>...</body>
Outline Tags: Represent each node in the mind map.
Example: <outline text="Top-Level Category"/>
Subcategories: Nested within an outline tag to represent sub-nodes.
Example:
xml
Copy code
<outline text="Top-Level Category">
  <outline text="Subcategory 1"/>
  <outline text="Subcategory 2"/>
</outline>
Notes: The _note attribute can be used to add explanatory details for each node.
Example: <outline text="Subcategory" _note="Additional details about this subcategory"/>
OPML Code Example for SimpleMind Pro:
xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<opml version="2.0">
  <head>
    <title>Arkhive WHO Section</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <outline text="Individuals">
      <outline text="People and Societies">
        <outline text="Notable Figures">
          <outline text="Leaders, Pioneers, Historical Figures" />
        </outline>
        <outline text="Biographies" />
      </outline>
    </outline>
  </body>
</opml>
Explanation:

Top-level node: The <outline> with text="Individuals" is the parent node.
Sub-nodes: Each nested <outline> represents subcategories.
Self-closing tags: When a node doesn’t contain further subcategories, it can be self-closed using />, such as in <outline text="Leaders, Pioneers, Historical Figures" />.
Notes: Use _note to provide additional details that will be displayed in SimpleMind as tooltips or extra information.
Summary of Differences
Create: Outline: A human-readable list, clear and simple without code. It uses indentation for hierarchy and does not include any OPML/XML syntax.

Create: Outline Code: Generates OPML code that is machine-readable, following XML format. This is the format intended for import into tools like SimpleMind Pro.

Example Prompts for AI
Prompt for Create: Outline:
"Create an outline for the WHO section of the Arkhive, keeping it simple for human reading."
Prompt for Create: Outline Code:
"Generate the OPML code for the WHO section of the Arkhive in a format readable by SimpleMind Pro."
