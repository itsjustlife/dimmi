the correct template for the structure of all the files here.

The correct template for OPML structure files: Eg: "<?xml version="1.0"?>
<opml version="1.0">
	<head>
		<title>
WALL
		</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<outline text="Test">
			<outline text="Testing"/>
			<outline text="Testing"/>
			<outline text="test">
				<outline text="test" _note="nots"/>
			</outline>
		</outline>
	</body>
</opml>
"
