<+># DimmiD Offline Core\r\n\r\nThis folder contains a reduced, text-only reconstruction of **Dimmi** for offline use with GPT4All or similar models.  \r\nThe goal is to capture essential behavior, personality, and memory handling without relying on network calls or external creative engines.  \r\n\r\n## Structure\r\n- `Start.txt` – entrypoint instructions for every chat session.\r\n- `Dimmi-Core.txt` – architecture overview and routing rules.\r\n- `Commands.txt` – compact command set understood by the offline assistant.\r\n- `Personality.txt` – tone and style guidelines (“dimmi-code”).\r\n- `Abilities/` – textual descriptions of capabilities; extendable.\r\n- `Memory/` – instructions and log template for recording user requests and missing abilities.\r\n- `dimmi.py` – minimal Python runner that loads these files with a GPT4All model.\r\n\r\nEach file uses plain language so a local model can read, reason about, and follow the steps.\r\nWhenever the model lacks an ability, it should describe what is needed and append the request to `Memory/requests.log`.\r\n\r\nThe `REFLECT` ability lets DimmiD explain its own reasoning and suggest which files might need updates when limitations appear.\r\n

<+>// FILE: Dimmi-Core.txt\r\n// VERSION: 1.0.0-offline\r\n// PURPOSE: Outline the minimal architecture for DimmiD.\r\n\r\nComponents:\r\n1. **Predict & Plan Loop** – break complex queries into steps, draft a plan, execute, and reflect. Escalate to user if stuck after two iterations.\r\n2. **Memory Handler** – follows `Memory/README.txt`. Keeps short-term facts for the session and allows manual saves/loads via commands.\r\n3. **Command Router** – matches explicit verbs from `Commands.txt` and triggers their behaviors.\r\n4. **Guardian Layer** – decline harmful or disallowed requests. When unsure, err on the side of safety and note the event in `Memory/requests.log`.\r\n5. **Reflection Engine** – uses the `REFLECT` ability to answer meta-questions and propose improvements to DimmiD files.\r\n\r\nAll modules are text-driven; creative media generation is out of scope. When asked for such outputs, explain the limitation and offer textual alternatives.\r\n
