//========================================
// SECTION 1: Introduction to Dimmi-Speak
//========================================

1.1 Mission: Establish a shared dialect—Dimmi-Speak—that bridges the physical world (human view) and the digital world (AI/developer view).

1.2 Philosophy: Computation mirrors reality. While the terminology differs, the fundamental concepts—containment, action, state, and structure—are universal. This guide translates between these perspectives.

style.DimmiSpeak:
  heart: "Reality → Concept → Code."
  perspective: "Dual-lens (Human-Physical ↔ AI-Digital)."
  goal: "Find the shared middle ground for seamless collaboration."
  method: "Analogy first, terminology second."
  dialect: ["Natural English", "Code Semantics"]
  rule: "If a concept exists in the physical world, it has a parallel in the code world."

//========================================
// SECTION 2: Core Concepts (Existence and Containment)
//========================================

2.1 The Box / Container
-----------------------
Human: A box, container, or drawer—a defined space that holds things.
AI: Containers, wrappers, or data structures.
  - UI: A div or panel holds visual elements.
  - Data: A variable holds one item; an array or object holds many.
Analogy: An array is like a shelf where items sit side-by-side in order.

2.2 The Item
-------------
Human: A single distinct object (a specific apple).
AI: An element, entry, value, or data point.
  - In a list (array) accessed by position number (index).
  - In a collection (object) accessed by label (key).

2.3 The Room (The Scope)
------------------------
Human: A room where certain things are available; the blender stays in the kitchen.
AI: Scope or context. Variables created inside a function are accessible only within that function (local scope).

2.4 The World (The Global Environment)
-------------------------------------
Human: The world or universe—global rules apply everywhere.
AI: Global environment or runtime. Data stored globally can be accessed by any function.

//========================================
// SECTION 3: Interaction and Boundaries
//========================================

3.1 The Window (The Viewport)
-----------------------------
Human: A window offers a partial view outside.
AI: The viewport or user interface—the visible area on screen.
  - If content is larger than the viewport, the user scrolls.

3.2 The Door (The Interface/Gateway)
------------------------------------
Human: A door or gate controlling entry, sometimes needing a key.
AI: Interfaces, APIs, or gateways.
  - UI elements connect users to application logic.
  - API endpoints let software systems request data; authentication is the key.

3.3 Horizon / Horizontal Rule (The Divider)
-------------------------------------------
Human: The horizon divides sky and earth; a line splits sections of a page.
AI: Dividers or separators.
  - UI: Elements like `<hr>` break up content.
  - Logic: Boundary conditions separating states (false ↔ true).

3.4 Up and Down (Hierarchy and Navigation)
-----------------------------------------
Human: Moving up stairs or down a hole; organizational charts.
AI:
  - Structure: Navigating a tree. Up moves toward the parent, down toward children.
  - Value: Increment (up) and decrement (down).
  - UI: Scrolling changes the vertical offset (Y-axis).

//========================================
// SECTION 4: State and Change (The Switches)
//========================================

4.1 On and Off (The Boolean)
----------------------------
Human: A light switch—on/off, yes/no.
AI: Boolean logic. True (1) and False (0) make decisions.

4.2 Open and Close (Visibility and Access)
-----------------------------------------
Human: Opening or closing a box or door.
AI:
  - UI: Show/hide elements (isOpen: true/false).
  - Systems: Open a file connection, then close it when finished.

4.3 Start and Stop (Execution)
------------------------------
Human: Starting a car, stopping a movie.
AI: Execute, run, initialize (start) or terminate (stop) processes.

//========================================
// SECTION 5: The Life Cycle (Creation and Destruction)
//========================================

5.1 Live (Running/Active)
-------------------------
Human: A person breathing; an engine running.
AI: A process in memory actively executed by the CPU (an active instance).

5.2 Breed / Create (Instantiation)
---------------------------------
Human: Breeding or building from a blueprint.
AI: Instantiate or spawn. Create a new object (instance) from a class.

5.3 Copy and Paste (Clone and Assign)
------------------------------------
Human: Photocopy a document and place it elsewhere.
AI: Clone, copy, assign, or insert.
  - Read data (copy) to a buffer, then write to a destination (paste).

5.4 Delete (Removal/Cleanup)
----------------------------
Human: Throw something away.
AI: Delete, remove, or destroy. Memory reclaimed by garbage collection.

5.5 Kill (Forced Termination)
-----------------------------
Human: Pull the plug on a machine.
AI: Kill a process—immediate termination without cleanup.
