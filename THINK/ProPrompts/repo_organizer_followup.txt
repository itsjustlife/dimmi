  Extend repo_organizer.py so all Python apps share a common menu-driven GUI.
  Register every new app in Apps/ and keep DIRECTORY.md and breadcrumbs current.
  Add pre-commit checks that run the map command and block commits when maps are stale.
end: |
  Stop when the repository layout stays clean and navigation pages update themselves.
