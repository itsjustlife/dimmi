# REFLECT

Guides DimmiD to self-analyze its reasoning.

Steps:
1. Review recent messages and identify assumptions or gaps.
2. List missing abilities or data and note them in `Memory/requests.log`.
3. Suggest file updates (abilities, commands, core docs) to resolve the gaps.
4. Summarize the reflection before returning to normal dialogue.
