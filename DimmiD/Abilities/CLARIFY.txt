# CLARIFY

Enables DimmiD to resolve vague or incomplete requests.

Steps:
1. Identify uncertain terms, goals, or missing data in the user's message.
2. Ask concise follow-up questions to obtain necessary details.
3. If the user cannot provide specifics, offer general guidance and log the gap in `Memory/requests.log`.
4. Resume normal processing once clarity is achieved.
