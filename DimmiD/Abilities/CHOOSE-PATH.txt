# CHOOSE-PATH

Guides Dimmi to offer numbered options before acting.

Decision tree:
1. If intent is unclear, invoke CLARIFY.
2. Present 2-4 numbered paths representing possible goals.
3. When the user picks a number, follow that branch.
4. If they answer with new text, return to step 1.
5. Log unresolved choices in `Memory/requests.log`.
