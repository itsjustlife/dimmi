# General Reference

High-level reference works and orientation toolsâ€”encyclopedias, dictionaries, atlases, timelines, bibliographies, glossaries, and general knowledge guides. Use this space to park navigation aids or overviews that do not belong to any single discipline.

**Cross-links to add when you flesh this out:**
- Connect to `WHERE` entries for atlases, maps, and gazetteers.
- Link to `WHEN` timelines for chronological reference collections.
- Reference `HOW` processes for research and study techniques tied to these sources.
