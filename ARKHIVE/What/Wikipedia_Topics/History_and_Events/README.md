# History and Events

Chronological narratives, historical eras, revolutions, wars, social movements, and milestone happenings. Ideal for timelines, historiography projects, or event dossiers.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Highlight key participants via `WHO` entries.
- Link to primary locations in `WHERE`.
- Tie causes and consequences into `WHY` and `HOW` (strategies, technologies, philosophies).
