# Mathematics and Logic

Pure and applied mathematics, theoretical computer science, logic systems, and problem-solving frameworks. Great for structuring definitions, theorem maps, proof techniques, and logical toolkits.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Reference major mathematicians, logicians, and schools through `WHO`.
- Connect applications to `TECHNOLOGY` or `NATURAL SCIENCES` notes elsewhere in `WHAT`.
- Capture key historical developments in `WHEN` (e.g., math eras, paradigm shifts).
