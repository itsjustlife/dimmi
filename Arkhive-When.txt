========================================
WHEN – Timeline of Events and Temporal Anchors
========================================
The WHEN branch organizes knowledge by time. It includes historical events, periods, dates, and chronological sequences. If a question is about when something happened or the historical timeline of a topic, this branch is central. This file describes how the timeline is structured and how to index events for easy traversal.

========================================
SECTION 1: SCOPE OF WHEN
========================================
WHEN covers:
- Historical Events: Significant occurrences (wars, discoveries, treaties, disasters, births/deaths) assignable to a date or range.
- Periods/Eras: Broader time spans (e.g., "The Renaissance," "Jurassic Period," "Information Age") serving as containers for events.
- Year or Date Entries: Specific years (e.g., 1776, 1945) or dates listing major events. Clustering by decade/century may occur for granularity.
- Timelines of Topics: Potential sub-branches for specific domains ("Timeline of Computing"), though often derived via cross-linking from events.

========================================
SECTION 2: STRUCTURE AND CHRONOLOGY
========================================

2.1. Hierarchy Design & Navigation Principles:
    - 3-Click Rule (Depth vs. Breadth): Optimized for reaching nodes within ~3 levels (e.g., WHEN -> 20th Century -> World War II). Achieved by minimizing unnecessary layers and using cross-links for lateral jumps between related concepts in different branches (e.g., linking an event to its causes in WHY).
    - Chronological Ordering: Entries within any level are typically sorted chronologically (ascending).

2.2. Structuring Options (Often Mixed):
    - By Year/Century/Era: Top levels might be broad eras ("Antiquity," "Medieval," "Modern") or centuries ("19th Century," "20th Century"). Within these, events are listed chronologically. Major events might be direct nodes under an era/century (e.g., "World War II (1939–1945)" under "20th Century").
    - By Theme: While primarily chronological, thematic timelines (e.g., "Timeline of Space Exploration") might exist as distinct structures or be represented through tags/cross-links from the main timeline.

2.3. Event Entries:
    - Naming: Nodes are typically named after the event, including date(s) in parentheses (e.g., "Fall of Berlin Wall (1989)"). Alternatively, a date node might contain event descriptions. Event names are generally preferred for nodes.
    - Subsections/Nesting: Major complex events (like World Wars) might have sub-nodes for key battles or phases, nested under the main event node to maintain clarity while managing depth.

2.4. Note on Linear vs Non-linear Time:
    - Current structure leans linear and Gregorian/Western-focused.
    - Acknowledged limitation: Difficulty representing cyclical time or non-Western calendars directly in the main hierarchy.
    - Mitigation: Incorporate other calendars via cross-reference within entries (e.g., noting Islamic or Chinese calendar equivalents). Future enhancements could include parallel timeline structures or specific nodes for different cosmologies/calendars if required by the knowledge domain.

========================================
SECTION 3: ENTRY CONVENTIONS
========================================
- Event Description: Succinctly state what happened, where, and key actors involved. Link to relevant WHO/WHERE entries.
- Dates: Use standard formats (Month Day, Year or YYYY-MM-DD). Include specific dates for precise events, ranges for periods.
- Chronological Order: Ensure entries under any given node are sorted by date.
- Periodic Summaries: Nodes representing long periods (e.g., "Middle Ages") should contain a summary of the era, potentially linking to key sub-events.
- Recurring Events: Handle recurring events (Olympics, elections) generally with a summary node, listing only historically significant instances rather than every occurrence, unless the context demands it.
- Use of Subsections: Use indentation or sub-lists to detail sub-events under a major event node (e.g., specific battles under a war node).

========================================
SECTION 4: CROSS-LINKS AND CONTEXT
========================================
WHEN entries are heavily interlinked:
- WHO links: Mention key people involved (linking to `Arkhive-Who.txt`). Include notable births/deaths under relevant year/period nodes.
- WHERE links: Specify primary location(s) (linking to `Arkhive-Where.txt`).
- WHAT links: Connect events to related concepts, technologies, or types of events (linking to `Arkhive-What.txt`). (e.g., Sputnik launch links to "Artificial Satellite" concept).
- WHY links: Crucially link events to their causes and consequences (found in `Arkhive-Why.txt`). (e.g., French Revolution entry links to causes like "Enlightenment Ideas," "Social Inequality").
- MIND links: Connect events related to ideas, science, or philosophy to relevant cognitive/logical concepts (linking to `Arkhiver-Mind.txt`). (e.g., Galileo's trial links to "Scientific Paradigms").
- HOW links: Link events involving specific methods or inventions to relevant process/technology descriptions (potentially in `Arkhive-What.txt` or `Arkhiver-Mind.txt`). (e.g., Wright brothers' flight links to "Aviation" or "Aerodynamics").
- Within WHEN links:
    - Sequence Links: Explicitly reference preceding or subsequent related events (e.g., WWI entry notes it led to Treaty of Versailles, which influenced WWII).
    - Parallel Events: Note concurrent significant events elsewhere if relevant ("While X occurred in Europe...").
    - Period Containers: Note when events mark the beginning or end of named periods.

========================================
SECTION 5: MANAGING THE TIMELINE
========================================
- Global Coverage: Include major events from diverse world regions to avoid excessive Western-centricity (e.g., Mughal Empire, Meiji Restoration).
- Non-Western Chronologies: Integrate via era nodes (e.g., "Heian Period," "Ming Dynasty") or parenthetical calendar notes within Gregorian-dated entries.
- Crono Integration Concept: User's personal timeline events (if tracked via a 'Crono' system concept linked to `Dimmi-Memory.txt`) should likely remain tagged as personal or stored separately to avoid cluttering the global historical timeline, though conceptual links are possible.
- Future/Ongoing Events: Can include planned future dates (marked clearly) or ongoing events (e.g., "Syrian Civil War (2011– )"). Requires updates as events conclude.
- Relative Terms: Avoid "today," "yesterday." Use absolute dates or fixed references ("as of [date]..."). Dimmi translates user's relative terms using current system date.

WHEN: The Temporal Dimension of Knowledge (Preface)

Time is the grand canvas on which the story of humanity is painted. The WHEN category of the Arkhive is a narrative timeline that spans from the prehistoric dawn of civilization to the speculative future. It covers all historical epochs and chronological frameworks – prehistoric, ancient, classical, medieval, early modern, industrial, modern, postmodern, contemporary, and beyond – providing a temporal map of human, technological, cultural, political, and philosophical evolution. In historical scholarship, dividing the past into distinct periods (known as periodization) helps us organize and interpret the vast continuum of events​. The WHEN branch follows this practice, charting prehistorical periods (before written records) and historical periods (recorded history)​ in an intuitive hierarchy of eras and events. Understanding the temporal structure of knowledge greatly enhances our comprehension of how different facets of civilization develop. By examining when things happened, we uncover cause-and-effect relationships and contextual links between developments in disparate domains. For example, Enlightenment ideals of reason in the 18th century eroded old feudal and religious orders and sparked political revolutions and the Industrial Revolution​. Those late-18th-century upheavals in turn ushered in the industrial age of mechanization​, eventually setting the stage for the digital information age of the late 20th century. Each era builds upon the last: ideas and inventions compound over time, and understanding when they arose helps explain why they emerged. Technological breakthroughs often occur in response to the needs and values of their time, and political or philosophical movements can be fully grasped only against the backdrop of the era’s conditions. Crucially, the WHEN timeline weaves together thematic overlays for each era – major wars, technological innovations, cultural renaissances, political transformations, and ideological movements – to show how they interplay. By situating key people, places, and ideas in their chronological context, we gain insight into how human society has evolved. We see, for instance, how the Industrial Age not only introduced new machines, but also fundamentally transformed social and political structures (urbanization, imperialism) as an outgrowth of earlier Enlightenment thought​. We observe how the Modern Age (up to the mid-20th century) embraced grand narratives of progress and rationality, which were later questioned in the Postmodern Age shaped by events like the Cold War and the rise of the Internet​. In other words, understanding when each transformation happened allows us to trace the evolution of human ideas (philosophy and ideology), scientific and technological capabilities, cultural norms, and political systems as an interconnected story. In the Arkhive’s WHEN branch, each major epoch is represented as a node with nested sub-periods, events, and milestones. Concise notes highlight cross-references to WHO (notable figures of the time), WHAT (key inventions or concepts), WHERE (geographic focal points), WHY (motives or causes), and HOW (methods or processes) for that era. This temporal framework not only chronologically catalogs events, but also illuminates the continuity and transitions across eras – for example, how the Enlightenment → Industrial Revolution → Information Age progression unfolded through cascading cause and effect. By navigating the WHEN timeline, one can intuitively follow the chain of history: how prehistoric human innovations enabled ancient civilizations, how ancient ideas influenced classical empires, how those foundations led to medieval institutions, which gave rise to early modern revolutions, and so on, all the way to today’s complex global society and future possibilities. This comprehensive temporal perspective deepens our understanding of every other domain in the Arkhive, revealing the evolution of ideas and innovations through time and enhancing our ability to connect people, places, technologies, and ideas in context.

/// PS — Supplemental Enhancements (v 3.0.0-addendum)

• Quick-Add Skeleton  
  `Event | Date(s) | One-line summary | Key links:[WHO, WHERE, WHY, HOW] | Tags:[era, domain]`

• Synonym / Alias Table  
  Maintain an `aka:` field so “9/11” == “September 11 2001 Attacks”; prevents duplicate event nodes and boosts fuzzy search.

• Redundancy-Check Heuristic  
  If a proposed WHEN entry shares ≥ 85 % title + date similarity with an existing node, auto-link as alias and flag `#when-possible-dupe`.

• Scene-DNA Hook  
  Optional `sceneDNA` field (palette / mood / BPM) for events that feed narrative or creative modules.

• Auto-OPML Snapshot  
  Whenever > 15 WHEN nodes are added in a batch, trigger `EXPORT format="OPML" branch="WHEN"` for version tracking.

• Road-Map Parity  
  – Comparative “parallel-timeline” viewer (future GPT Action)  
  – Quick command: `COMPARE WHEN:<era1> vs <era2> (dimension=events|innovation|conflicts)`  
  – Visual heat-map overlay showing event density per century

/// KNOWLEDGE PATHWAY FOOTER
/// ENTRYPOINT: Use for time-based queries, events, timelines, periodization, or historical structure.
/// OUTPUT: Pass WHEN structure, timeline updates, event links, and summary to Start.txt for path trace.
/// CHECKLIST: Did I log/organize events by correct chronology and granularity? Are cross-links to WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHY/HOW validated?
/// PATH TRACE: Log timeline node updated, period/event cross-links, and flag any temporal ambiguity or need for deeper branch consult.
