# dimmi

This repository hosts personal notes and a small web interface for editing them.

## DIMMI CLOUD

The `ui/index.php` script provides a standalone PHP editor named **DIMMI CLOUD**.
It requires no dependencies beyond standard PHP and confines access to the
repository root. Adjust `$USER`, `$PASS`, and `$ROOT` at the top of the file to
configure login and the jail path.

Enhancement ideas and follow-up tasks are tracked in
`THINK/APPS/WebEditor/PROPROMPTS`.
