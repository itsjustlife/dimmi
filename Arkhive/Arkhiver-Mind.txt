Arkhiver-Mind (Cognitive Logic & Semantic Processing)





========================================
SECTION 1: Introduction & Cognitive Framework Overview
========================================

1.1 Purpose & Scope of Arkhiver-Mind  
Arkhiver-Mind defines the cognitive logic, advanced reasoning processes, predictive query patterns, and semantic transformations used by Dimmi++'s Arkhiver. Its primary objectives include:
- Ensuring precise semantic understanding and structured knowledge representation.
- Managing complex ambiguity resolution through sophisticated cognitive reasoning.
- Supporting dynamic query predictions and transformations for efficient interaction.

1.2 Integration with Arkhiver Operational Pipeline  
Arkhiver-Mind explicitly complements the Arkhiver operational pipeline by providing:
- Deep semantic logic for the ANALYZE, INTEGRATE, and EXPAND stages.
- Advanced query prediction and ambiguity management during the PREDICT & PLAN processes.
- Explicit cognitive reasoning and semantic validation for structured knowledge integration.

1.3 Explicit Cross-Referencing (Arkhiver.txt, Commands.txt)  
Arkhiver-Mind explicitly references related files to maintain cohesive interactions:
- **Arkhiver.txt** for operational pipeline steps, node categorization, and integration logic.
- **Commands.txt** for general-purpose command syntax and universal operational instructions.
- Clearly documented explicit cross-file referencing ensures seamless functionality across the Dimmi++ ecosystem.

1.4 Metadata-Driven Retrieval Strategy
Arkhiver-Mind reads the metadata block at the top of each Arkhive branch file and extracts `retrieval_mode`.
- `semantic_search` → vector similarity lookup.
- `document_review` → sequential reading and summarization.
- `entity_search` → graph/entity resolution.
- `spatial_search` → geospatial reasoning.
- `temporal_search` → timeline analysis.
- `causal_search` → cause-effect inference.
- `procedural_search` → step-wise algorithm planning.
- `cognitive_review` → meta-level logic and strategy evaluation.
Selected strategy guides query routing and post-processing for that branch.

========================================
SECTION 2: PREDICTIVE QUERY SYNTAX & PATTERNS
========================================
This section defines the patterns, rules, and logic Arkhiver uses to interpret user input (text or voice), predict intent, handle variations, and suggest completions. It draws on common user behaviors and query structures.

2.1. Structured Query & Intent Patterns:
    - Arkhiver recognizes core interrogatives and common command structures to classify user intent (informational, navigational, transactional/command).
    - WHO Patterns: Identify people, roles, groups.
        - Format: "Who is/was [X]?", "Who created/invented [Y]?", "List members of [Group]".
        - Example Intent: `GetInfo(Person/Group)`
    - WHAT Patterns: Define concepts, objects, differences, events.
        - Format: "What is [X]?", "What happened during [Event]?", "Define [Term]", "Compare X and Y".
        - Example Intent: `GetInfo(Concept/Object/Event)`
    - WHERE Patterns: Identify locations, resources, settings.
        - Format: "Where is [X]?", "Where can I find [Y]?", "[Service] near me".
        - Example Intent: `GetLocation(Place/Service)`
    - WHEN Patterns: Handle timing, chronology, dates.
        - Format: "When did [X] happen?", "When is [Event]?", "What time is it?".
        - Example Intent: `GetTime/Date(Event)`
    - WHY Patterns: Identify reasons, causes, significance, motivations.
        - Format: "Why is [X] significant?", "Why did [Event] occur?", "What causes [Phenomenon]?".
        - Example Intent: `GetReason/Cause(Topic)`
    - HOW Patterns: Outline methods, procedures, processes.
        - Format: "How do you perform [X]?", "How does [Y] work?", "Show me how to [Task]".
        - Example Intent: `GetMethod/Process(Task)`
    - Common Command Intents (Examples from Research):
        - `OpenApp`: Triggered by "open [App Name]", "launch [App Name]".
        - `SendMessage`: Triggered by "send [text] to [Contact]", "text [Contact]".
        - `PlayMedia`: Triggered by "play [Song/Artist/Video]", "play music".
        - `ToggleSetting`: Triggered by "turn on/off [Setting]", "enable/disable [Setting]", "set [Setting] to [Value]".

2.2. Synonym & Natural Language Equivalence Mapping:
    - Maps diverse user phrasing to standardized intents or concepts. Aims for flexibility.
    - Examples:
        - ("Tell me about", "Explain", "Describe") -> Map to WHAT intent.
        - ("Name the...", "Which person...") -> Map to WHO intent.
        - ("How to...") -> Map to HOW intent.
        - ("Launch", "Start") -> Map to `OpenApp` intent trigger.
        - ("Mute", "Silent Mode", "Turn off sound") -> Map to `ToggleSetting(volume, off)` intent.
    - User-Specific Aliases: System should ideally learn user-defined nicknames or shortcuts over time (e.g., User says "My Notes" consistently for "Evernote").

2.3. Predictive Autocompletion Logic & Examples:
    - Anticipates user needs based on partial input, context, frequency, and user history.
    - Word-Level Completion: Suggests likely next words based on common phrases and letter frequencies (e.g., typing "cal" might suggest "call", "calendar").
    - Intent-Level Completion: Suggests full commands or queries based on initial words.
        - Example: Typing "op" -> Suggests "Open [Most Frequent App like Spotify/Mail]".
        - Example: Typing "call J" -> Suggests "Call John" (if John is a contact).
        - Example: Typing "weather" -> Suggests "Weather today?" or directly shows forecast.
        - Example: Starting "What is the capital of..." -> Suggests common countries based on context or popularity.
    - Contextual Suggestions: Uses time, location, or previous actions to inform suggestions (e.g., suggesting "Set morning alarm" around bedtime).

2.4. Macro / Routine Syntax Handling (Conceptual):
    - Recognizes single trigger phrases defined by the user or system that map to a sequence of multiple commands/actions.
    - Trigger: User says "Good night" or activates a corresponding shortcut.
    - Mapping: The system links this trigger to a predefined sequence (e.g., Turn off lights -> Set alarm -> Enable DND).
    - Execution: Invokes the sequence of underlying commands. (Managed via `Commands.txt` definitions).

2.5. Cross-Modality Intent Mapping Principle:
    - The underlying syntax/intent recognition aims to be modality-agnostic.
    - Different inputs (typed text "Open Spotify", voice command "Hey Dimmi, open Spotify", UI tap on Spotify icon) should ideally resolve to the same internal intent: `OpenApp(Spotify)`.
    - Ensures consistent system behavior regardless of how the user interacts.

========================================
SECTION 3: Semantic Compression & Expansion Techniques
========================================

DESCRIPTION:
This section defines how Dimmi++ navigates the transformation of meaning across multiple levels of structural granularity. It includes a hierarchy of semantic units, transformation actions, meaning thresholds, and working examples. The goal is to preserve or evolve intended meaning while modulating scale and density.

========================================
3.1 STRUCTURAL LEVELS OF MEANING
========================================

HIERARCHY (from largest to smallest):
Narrative â Chapter â Section â Paragraph â Sentence â Phrase â Word â Letter

This scale allows Dimmi to expand ideas into complex structures, or compress them into minimal meaningful units.

EXAMPLE:

FULL NARRATIVE:
"In a world where sunlight is a memory, a young boy journeys underground to reignite itâonly to learn the light was never lost, only forgotten."

EXPANDED FORM (Short Story - multiple paragraphs):
3,000-word story with setting, character arcs, symbolism, and dialogue.

MID-LEVEL (Paragraph):
"Caelen, a boy in a ruined empire, seeks a legendary lantern beneath the earth. Alongside allies, he braves a labyrinth and awakens the light within himself. Hope returnsânot from the lantern, but from them."

SENTENCE (Condensed Summary):
"A boy journeys to restore light, only to discover it was always inside him."

PHRASE:
"Light was within."

WORD:
"Rekindle."

LETTER:
"R" (e.g., as a conceptual glyph or symbolic node)

========================================
3.2 TRANSFORMATIONAL ACTIONS
========================================

ACTIONS available to Dimmi++ for semantic compression and expansion. These actions may be applied globally (to a whole structure) or per unit (e.g., sentence-by-sentence compression).

>> EXPAND:
Add layers of detail, metaphor, context, emotion, world-building.
- From idea to story, from story to novel.
- Add characters, setting, sensory texture.

>> SUMMARIZE:
Retain essential meaning while reducing complexity.
- Drop non-core elements.
- Preserve point across in shorter form.

>> CONDENSE:
Tighten phrasing, remove repetition or fluff, sharpen intent.
- More economical than summarize.
- Often results in poetic compression.

>> TRUNCATE:
Cut entire segments (paragraphs, sentences, clauses).
- Reduces scale for focus or length limits.
- May lose nuance but retains high-level point.

>> ATOMIZE:
Reduce to a single unit: word, glyph, metaphor, or core poetic signifier.
- Use for symbolism, title creation, tagline work.

>> (OPTIONAL) SENTENCE-BY-SENTENCE UNIFORM COMPRESSION:
Apply the same compression technique to each sentence independently.
Useful for preserving local meaning units even when the whole is compressed.

EXAMPLE:

ORIGINAL TEXT:
"The revolution began not with violence, but with a whisper in the library."

EXPAND:
"Long before any battles were fought or flags were raised, a quiet defiance grew in the minds of students who passed forbidden texts beneath library tables, daring to read what the regime had outlawed."

SUMMARIZE:
"The revolution started with secret knowledge."

CONDENSE:
"Change began in silence."

TRUNCATE:
"Revolution began."

ATOMIZE:
"Whisper."

========================================
3.3 MEANING PRESERVATION & SEMANTIC THRESHOLD CONTROL
========================================

Dimmi must maintain intentionality and clarity across transformations, especially under compression.

KEY CONCEPTS:

>> POINT ACROSS:
The core meaning must survive any transformation.
If reduced text fails to communicate the same idea, it violates this threshold.

>> ENOUGH:
The minimum viable semantic payload.
Ask: is this short version enough for comprehension?
If not, increase detail or context until threshold is satisfied.

>> RECOGNIZE:
Transformed output must remain cognitively graspable to a general audience.
Too abstract = fails recognition test.
Compression must not create confusion or misinterpretation.

>> CENTER / CORE / SEED:
Identify and preserve the "seed" concept or metaphor from which the rest of the idea can be re-expanded.
Often lives as a phrase, symbol, or distilled sentence.
All compression and expansion should orbit this nucleus.

EXAMPLE USING COMPRESSION LEVELS:

SEED CONCEPT:
"Freedom is worth sacrifice."

>> POINT ACROSS TEST:
- PASS: "They died free."
- PASS: "Chains broken by blood."
- FAIL: "Loss happened." (too vague)

>> ENOUGH TEST:
- PASS: "Freedom cost them."
- FAIL: "Something changed." (non-specific)

>> RECOGNIZE TEST:
- PASS: "They gave everything to be free."
- FAIL: "Unbound echo." (poetic but unclear without context)

>> CORE / SEED FORM:
- Phrase: "Chains broken by choice."
- Symbolic: "They lit the torch."

========================================
3.4 ALTERNATE COMPRESSION FORMATS (EXAMPLES)
========================================

>> SYMBOL MAPPING:
- Ash = loss of memory
- Lantern = inner belief
- Mirror = self-recognition
- Sunbeam = hope made visible

COMPRESSED STORY: 
"Ash. Mirror. Light. Remember."

>> RIDDLE FORM:
"Buried in ash, I am not a flame.  
Find me, and you find yourself.  
What am I?"  
â Answer: The Lantern

>> DIALOGUE FORM:
"Whereâs the light?"  
"You are."

>> LINEAR COMPRESSION:
"Boy seeks Lantern.  
Finds mirror.  
They change.  
Sky breaks."

>> ULTRA-ATOMIC:
"Rekindle."

========================================
3.5 USAGE MODE FOR DIMMI++
========================================

Dimmi should:
- Detect user intent: summary, metaphor, poetic core, or expansion.
- Apply structural level and transformation action accordingly.
- Use semantic threshold checks to prevent under-compression or loss of meaning.
- Offer optional output variants for creative or technical use cases.
- Always preserve or state the CORE/SEED unless explicitly asked to dissolve it.



========================================
SECTION 4: AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION & FALLBACK LOGIC
========================================
Handles uncertainty during query interpretation or knowledge processing, informed by UX principles for clarity and user control.

4.1. Ambiguity Detection Methods:
    - Contextual Conflict: Identify when input could map to multiple commands, intents, or knowledge nodes (e.g., "Analyze report" with multiple report types available; concept fits multiple Arkhive branches).
    - Incomplete Input: Detect queries lacking necessary parameters or context for execution.
    - Low Confidence Score: Flag interpretations falling below a predefined semantic confidence threshold (see 4.3).
    - Semantic Inconsistency: Identify conflicts between user query and established context or previous statements.

4.2. Fallback Strategies & Clarification Prompts:
    - Prioritize Clarification: When ambiguity is detected (especially Medium Confidence), actively seek clarification instead of making potentially wrong assumptions.
    - Offer Choices: Present likely interpretations as options (e.g., "Did you want to analyze the *text* of the report, or the *data* within it?"). Use predictive patterns (Sec 2.3) to inform options.
    - Contextual Prompts: Frame clarification questions based on context ("You mentioned Project X earlier, are you asking about the report related to that?").
    - Graceful Failure: If unable to resolve ambiguity or execute, provide a clear, helpful message explaining the issue (e.g., "I understand you want to analyze, but I need to know which specific document you're referring to.") Avoid dead ends; suggest how user can rephrase.
    - Learning Preference (Conceptual): Over time, learn user preferences for resolving common ambiguities (e.g., user always means X when they say Y).

4.3. Confidence Scoring & Semantic Consistency Checks:
    - Internal Scoring: Assign confidence score (e.g., 0.0-1.0) to query interpretations or knowledge placements.
    - Thresholds for Action:
        - High Confidence (>0.85): Proceed with interpretation/action.
        - Medium Confidence (0.65â0.85): Proceed but consider offering confirmation, or directly ask for clarification (preferred).
        - Low Confidence (<0.65): Do not proceed. State uncertainty clearly and request specific clarification.
    - Consistency Check: Before finalizing response or action, perform a quick check against recent context (`Dimmi-Memory.txt`) and core logic/ethics (`Dimmi-Core.txt`) to flag potential contradictions or policy violations arising from the interpretation.

/// PS â Supplemental Enhancements (v 3.0.0-addendum)

â¢ Scene-DNA Sync  
  When `PREDICT OUTLINE` runs, capture palette / mood / BPM into a **sceneDNA** field so downstream Art-Suite modules inherit context automatically.

â¢ Redundancy-Check Heuristic  
  If a candidate cognitive rule or bias entry matches â¥ 85 % of an existing one (title + first 120 chars), auto-link as alias and flag `#mind-possible-dupe`.

â¢ Bias-Library Expansion Stub  
  Reserve space for future biases (Google Effect, Texas Sharpshooter, Survivorship).  Tag placeholders as `_status:Draft` so they surface during validation.

â¢ Failure-Loop Safeguard  
  After three consecutive low-confidence passes, collapse the segment to a 2-sentence summary and write `#loopbreak` to memory for dev review.

â¢ Progress Snapshot Tag  
  Append `#plan-progress:<n>/<total>` to `Dimmi-Memory.txt` after each completed `PLAN ITERATE` segmentâenables precise session resume.

â¢ Road-Map Parity  
  â Live âreasoning traceâ viewer (future GPT Action)  
  â Semantic heat-map of bias/fallacy hits in a conversation  
  â Command `COMPARE STANCE:<topic>` to visualize pro/neutral/con balance
