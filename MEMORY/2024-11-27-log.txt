### Session 2024-11-27

**Summary:**
- User requested creation of an `ABILITIES` collection to store ability files.
- Added the first ability `Dimmi-Code` describing conversational translation to code.
- User also asked for a "prompt first" ability so Dimmi clarifies before acting.
- Began a `MEMORY` section to track summaries and open questions.

**Understanding of Request:**
The user wants a framework where Dimmi learns abilities and retains memories of interactions. They emphasize collaborative evolution and structured logs that capture both what was asked and what Dimmi needs next.

**Open Questions / Research Prompts:**
1. What format should future memory entries follow? Date-based files or one growing log?
2. How will abilities be referenced or activated in other parts of the project?
3. Should the memory system include tagging or indexing for easier retrieval?
