AI Sonic Art Creation Guide (Dimmi++)
Section 1: Suno AI Specifics
Capabilities & Prompt Structure: Suno AI is a state-of-the-art generative music system that produces songs with vocals and instrumentation from text prompts
en.wikipedia.org
. It operates with a three-part prompt setup: (1) a Style of Music prompt (~200 characters) defining genre, mood, and instrumentation, (2) an optional Lyrics prompt (up to 3,000 characters of custom lyrics), and (3) an Exclude Styles prompt for negative guidance (to tell Suno what to avoid)
reddit.com
. In practice, you describe the musical style separately from detailed lyrics. Suno’s v4 model introduced integrated lyric generation (the “ReMi” lyric model) which can write lyrics for you if needed
suno.com
. For optimal use, keep each field within its character limit and clearly separated (the interface provides distinct text boxes for style, lyrics, etc.). Always use Custom Mode for complex prompts so that you can access the lyrics field and exclude prompt field. Lyric Structure & Formatting: Suno supports structured lyric formatting using tags for song sections. You can delineate parts of the song by labeling sections like [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Intro], and [Outro] in the lyrics prompt
sunnoai.com
sunnoai.com
. This helps the AI understand the intended song layout and transition points. For example, you might format lyrics as:
txt
Copy
Edit
[Verse 1]
Walking a lonesome road under midnight skies, 
whispering secrets as the cold winds rise...

[Chorus]
And the stars sing along to my heart’s lonely tune, 
lighting the darkness I wander through…
Each section tag should appear on its own line, followed by the lyrics for that section. Maintain consistent casing (Suno’s parser recognizes capitalized tags in square brackets). Optionally, you can include directives in tags (e.g., “[Verse – softly]” to suggest a soft delivery). Use line breaks to separate lyrical lines as you would in a song; Suno will sing each line in rhythm. Keep the overall lyrics under ~3000 characters to avoid truncation
reddit.com
. If your lyrics are shorter than 3000 characters, you can utilize the remaining space for detailed stage directions (like vocal style or instrument cues) within brackets or asterisks. Optimal Prompting Practices: In the Style of Music prompt, be concise but specific about genre, mood, tempo, and instrumentation. For example: “A lively 90 BPM pop-rock track with upbeat guitar riffs, energetic drums, and soulful female vocals”. This field is limited (about 200 characters), so focus on key descriptors (genre, tempo, instruments, vibe). In the Lyrics field, structured lyrics can be accompanied by metatags and cues:
Metatags for Delivery: Use directives in square brackets within or before lines to influence vocals. E.g., “[whisper]” or “[shout]” before a line can cue the AI to alter the tone for that line.
Asterisks for Sound Effects: Enclose non-lyrical sounds or stage directions in asterisks. For instance: “[Bridge] guitar solo with heavy reverb” or “raindrops falling pitter-patter in the background”. Suno will attempt to incorporate these as audio cues or ambience
sunnoai.com
.
Uppercase for Emphasis: Write words in ALL CAPS if you want them emphasized or shouted (e.g., “NEVER let go” for a powerful belted word)
sunnoai.com
.
Mood and Tempo in Style Prompt: Always include an adjective for mood and an indicator of tempo or style era if relevant (e.g., “melancholic slow waltz”, “high-energy 80s synthwave”). Suno v4.5 responds well to evocative descriptions – you can even use imaginative phrases like “lush, uplifting nostalgic tones” to shape the feel
suno.com
.
Genres, Moods & Instrumentation: Suno supports a wide range of genres (from pop, rock, hip-hop, classical, EDM, jazz, etc., to niche styles like lo-fi, reggae, or gregorian chant) and can handle genre mashups
suno.com
. The v4.5 model improved accuracy in following specified genres and even combinations (e.g., “midwest emo with neo-soul” will blend elements more cohesively than earlier versions)
suno.com
. You should name the genre(s) or a well-known style reference in the style prompt. Moods can be specified with adjectives: haunting, joyful, aggressive, dreamy, somber, euphoric, etc., which influence chords and melodies (e.g., “melancholic ballad” yields minor key and slow tempo
sunnoai.com
). For instrumentation, simply list the instruments or sounds you want: e.g., “acoustic guitar and violin duet with subtle piano background”. Suno has been trained on a wide variety of instruments and will attempt to include those mentioned (common options include guitar, piano, drums, bass, strings, saxophone, synth pads, etc.)
sunnoai.com
. It can also handle less typical sound descriptors like “ambient drones,” “808 bass,” “synth arpeggios,” or even “choir harmonies.” If certain instruments dominate a genre (e.g. electric guitar in rock), Suno will include them by default, but explicitly mentioning instruments gives you more control
sunnoai.com
. Known Quirks: While Suno excels at producing realistic music, there are some quirks to be aware of:
Vocal Rendition: The AI vocals, while intelligible, may sometimes slur or mispronounce complex lyrics, especially at faster tempos or if the lyrics have dense syllable clusters. It tends to do best with lyric lines that flow and match the rhythm (see Section 6 on aligning lyrics). Extremely rapid lyrics (e.g. very fast rap) might become garbled or the AI might drop some words to keep up.
Repetition: Without guidance, Suno might repeat certain lyrics or melodic motifs. This can be desirable for chorus repetition, but to avoid unwanted looping, ensure your lyrics prompt doesn’t accidentally have duplicate lines unless repetition is intended. If the output still repeats phrases too often or feels “stuck,” try adding variety to the prompt or use the exclude prompt to forbid generic fillers (like “la la la” or overuse of “oh oh” if those appear).
Tempo and Rhythm: Specifying BPM (beats per minute) in the style prompt (e.g., “90 BPM” or “fast-paced” vs “slow tempo”) usually guides the tempo correctly, but occasionally the generated song’s tempo might not perfectly match a numerical BPM if the description is ambiguous. Use clear terms like “fast punk (around 180 BPM)” or “slow tempo R&B groove”. Known quirk: if you mix conflicting tempo words (e.g. “fast ballad”), the AI might produce a midtempo result; be consistent.
Complex Prompts: Very long or overly complex prompts might confuse the model. For example, a prompt that tries to pack in an entire story with many scene changes might lead to muddled output. It’s best to maintain focus or break the creation into sections (you can make multiple songs and later stitch or mix them if trying to create an epic). Suno v4.5 improved the prompt interpretation to capture more detail, but clarity is still key
suno.com
. If you find Suno ignoring part of your prompt, consider simplifying or reordering the prompt text to emphasize the crucial elements earlier.
Vocals and Harmony: By default, Suno will produce a lead vocal melody (and possibly unison backing vocals in chorus). It doesn’t allow you to explicitly write multi-part harmony for different singers in the prompt (the model handles harmony organically). If you want harmony, describe it: e.g., “harmonized chorus vocals” or “call-and-response between a male and female singer.” The output might then include multiple voices. Sometimes the vocals might sound slightly synthetic or have artifacts (especially on sustaining long high notes). This has improved with v4 and v4.5 (which introduced more emotional depth and vibrato in voices)
suno.com
, but be prepared that it’s not a real singer – there could be a robotic undertone in complex passages.
Length Constraints: Free-tier users had limits (like ~4 minutes for v3
en.wikipedia.org
). With v4.5, songs can be up to 8 minutes long for subscribers
suno.com
. Longer songs maintain coherence better now, but extremely long lyrics might still not be fully used if they exceed the model’s window. It’s wise to generate in segments if you need a very long composition (and perhaps use the new “Extend” feature to continue a track).
New in Version 4.5: The v4.5 model (released May 2025) brings several enhancements relevant to prompting
suno.com
suno.com
:
Expressiveness: It yields more dynamic and expressive music, following emotional descriptions more closely. You can use more evocative language in prompts (even poetic descriptions of the sound) and expect those nuances to influence the output
suno.com
suno.com
. For example, a prompt including “delicate, intimate vocal performance with a trembling vibrato” would more likely result in exactly that kind of vocal delivery on v4.5.
Genre Fidelity: A greatly expanded genre repertoire means even unusual genres or subgenres are recognized (try prompts like “synthwave tango” or “medieval folk with electronic elements”). The model adheres to genre conventions more accurately (chord progressions, instrumentation and mix appropriate to the genre)
suno.com
.
Richer Vocals: Vocals have an improved range – both in pitch and emotional tone. The model can sing more powerfully when asked (belting high notes) or more softly, and even add techniques like vibrato or falsetto when described
suno.com
. This means prompts specifying vocal style (e.g. “soulful raspy male vocals” or “ethereal choir-like vocals”) are better reflected in output.
Complex Sound Descriptors: v4.5 understands fine-grained sound design terms. You can include atmospheric or textural keywords (for instance, “leaf textures” or “underwater echo”) in your style prompt, and it will incorporate subtle corresponding sound elements
suno.com
. This opens the door to more cinematic or ambient music generation by purely textual description.
Prompt Enhancement Helper: The platform now offers a helper that can expand simple prompts into more detailed ones
suno.com
. For example, if you enter a basic genre, Suno can suggest a richer description automatically. This tool is integrated, but even if you’re writing prompts manually, you can mimic it by being more verbose and specific about each aspect of the music as outlined above.
Feature Combinations: Suno 4.5 allows combining Personas and Covers with base prompting
suno.com
. For instance, you could upload a sample song (Cover feature) and apply a saved persona (a style/voice profile from another song) to generate a new piece with both the structural essence of the sample and the sonic character of the persona. While this is beyond pure text prompting, it’s good to know if you seek greater control. (Persona creation involves saving the “essence” of a track’s vocal style and instrumentation, which you can then reapply).
Faster & Longer: Generation is faster and longer songs are supported as mentioned
suno.com
, meaning you can iterate more quickly on prompt tweaks.
Example Prompt (Style + Lyrics): Here’s a comprehensive example illustrating an optimal prompt format using all the above practices:
Style Prompt: “An epic cinematic pop song blending orchestral and EDM elements, slower 4/4 tempo (~75 BPM). Emotive female lead vocals with a hint of rasp, building from a soft piano intro to a powerful chorus with strings and synths. Overall mood is inspirational yet nostalgic.”
Lyrics Prompt:
txt
Copy
Edit
[Intro] *gentle rain sound* **soft piano chords** 
[Verse 1]
In the hush before the dawn, I feel the ages waking,  
Dust of dreams upon my skin, every memory shaking.  
[Pre-Chorus – softly]  
We are echoes in the night, yearning for the light of day,  
*(heartbeat drum softly starts)*  
[Chorus – powerful]  
WE WILL RISE, like fire through the shadow,  
Hearts igniting, burning bright through the sorrow.  
In our eyes, the visions of tomorrow,  
We will rise, we will rise.  
[Verse 2]  
Now the storm begins to break, but inside we grow stronger,  
Every tear and every ache only fuels our hunger.  
[Bridge – spoken word]  
*(male voice, spoken)* “Don’t let go… we carry the flame.”  
*(instrumental swell)*  
[Chorus – triumphant]  
WE WILL RISE... (repeat Chorus lines with fuller orchestra)  
[Outro]  
*choir humming a gentle reprise of the chorus melody, rain fades out*
In this example, the style prompt lays out genre fusion (orchestral + EDM), tempo, instrumentation (piano, strings, synths), vocal style, and mood. The lyrics are structured with tags for each section, include stage directions in asterisks (rain sound, heartbeat drum, instrumental swell), dynamic markings (softly, powerful, spoken word), and even a small spoken interlude. Such a prompt fully guides Suno in both what to sing and how to produce the sound, yielding a cohesive and emotionally rich song.
Section 2: Alternative AI Music, Voice, and Sound Platforms
Beyond Suno, there are several other AI platforms and models for music and audio. Each has different strengths, ideal use cases, and prompting methods. Below we compare prompting strategies, pros/cons, and when to use each alternative over Suno:
OpenAI Jukebox
Overview: OpenAI’s Jukebox is a neural network that generates raw music audio with vocals, given a genre, artist style, and (optionally) lyrics
developer.nvidia.com
toolify.ai
. It was a groundbreaking research model (released 2020) capable of mimicking the style of famous artists and producing novel songs in those styles. Jukebox works by conditioning on an artist/genre token and a lyrics snippet, then generating audio one chunk at a time. Prompting Strategy: Using Jukebox is quite technical – you typically provide:
An artist/genre specification (from a predefined list used during training) or even a “custom” embedding to mimic a style.
An optional lyrics prompt (it will try to have the AI sing these lyrics) or choose to let it free-form vocalize.
A prime audio clip (optional): Jukebox can continue from a short sample of real music (this guides it in style/melody initially).
Since it’s code-based, “prompting” involves editing a Python script or a notebook: e.g., selecting a preset like artist = "Elvis Presley", genre = "Rock" and providing a lyric text. There’s no simple user-friendly text box interface. Strengths: Jukebox’s unique strength is style mimicry – it learned from many artists’ music, so it can generate songs that sound uncannily like Elvis, Eminem, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. It can be useful if you specifically want to emulate a particular artist’s vibe or explore “What if X sang this?” scenarios (bearing in mind ethical and copyright considerations). It also gives fine control via the code for things like temperature, priming with existing audio, and it outputs separated vocals and instrument tracks which can be useful for mixing (the model internally has different levels). Weaknesses: The biggest downside is quality and coherence. Jukebox outputs are low fidelity compared to Suno – audio often has noticeable artifacts, muddiness, and the lyrics are “rudimentary” at best
openai.com
. Vocals may sound slurred or babble random syllables if no clear lyrics are enforced. It also requires heavy computational resources (generating a 1-minute song can take hours on a GPU). There’s no real-time or interactive aspect; it’s offline and experimental. Moreover, Jukebox is not actively updated, so it lacks the improvements in audio quality that newer systems (like Suno) have achieved. When to Use Jukebox Over Suno: Consider Jukebox if:
You need a specific famous artist’s style or voice (which Suno, for legal reasons, doesn’t explicitly allow). For example, if you want a song “in the style of The Beatles,” Jukebox might approximate that, whereas Suno focuses on original styles and might avoid sounding too close to existing songs.
You require open-source or offline generation. Jukebox’s code and model weights are available openly
cdn.openai.com
, so if you cannot use an online API or service like Suno (or need to modify the model for research), Jukebox is an option.
You are experimenting with AI music research, fine-tuning models, or need multi-modal outputs like separate vocal/instrument tracks to study.
For mainstream music creation, Suno generally outperforms Jukebox in quality and ease. Jukebox is a niche tool now, mainly for AI enthusiasts or those exploring legacy models.
Google Magenta (Music Generation Tools)
Overview: Magenta is a research project by Google focused on music and art generation. It’s not a single tool but a collection of models and algorithms. Key music-related models include MusicVAE, Melody RNN, Performance RNN, NSynth, and more. More recently, Google also introduced models like MusicLM (text-to-music) under their research (though as of 2024, MusicLM was a research paper and limited public demo). For our comparison, Magenta refers to the open-source toolkit which largely deals with symbolic music (MIDI) generation, as well as some audio synthesis models. Prompting Strategy: Magenta’s tools often require feeding in a seed or configuration rather than a natural language prompt:
Melody or Drum RNNs: You give a starting melody (or none) and the model continues it. Prompting here might be providing a sequence of notes or chords as input.
MusicVAE (Interpolation): You provide two melodies and it interpolates between them, or you sample random melodies from a learned distribution.
NSynth: Instead of generating full songs, NSynth generates new instrument sounds (single notes with novel timbres) by blending characteristics of instruments. Prompting NSynth is done by selecting instruments and notes (not via text).
Music Transformer (Performance RNN): It can generate piano performances when prompted with a few bars of piano as a primer.
In summary, Magenta doesn’t typically use plain English prompts. Instead, you “prompt” it with musical data (notes, MIDI, or parameters). One exception is if you use Magenta’s Tone Transfer or DDSP-based models: there you might give an audio input (like humming) and it “transfers” it to sound like a chosen instrument – again not text, but an audio prompt. Strengths: Magenta excels at fine-grained musical control for those who understand music theory and want to leverage AI to generate or assist in composition:
It produces results in MIDI or structured form, which means you can edit the AI’s output manually afterwards (change notes, orchestrate it differently). For example, you can use a Melody RNN to generate a melody, then orchestrate that melody yourself with your own instrument samples.
You can maintain harmonic control. By feeding chord progressions or guiding the model, you ensure the output is in a certain key or style. This is useful if you want AI to suggest ideas that you as a musician can tweak, rather than a full produced song.
Magenta’s models are lightweight and can often run on ordinary computers or in browsers (some have demos), making them accessible for developers. They are also open-source, allowing custom training on your own data (e.g., training a model on your personal MIDI compositions to generate similar music).
There are interactive tools like AI Duet (which uses a Magenta model to respond to your piano input in real-time), great for creative jamming or education. And Piano Genie turns keyboard input into more complex piano phrases. These are different from text-prompted generation and offer another kind of interactivity.
Weaknesses: Compared to Suno, Magenta’s outputs are not ready-to-listen audio. They’re often symbolic (MIDI) or single-instrument. This means additional work is needed to turn them into full songs. Also, Magenta by itself doesn’t handle vocals/lyrics (except an early experiment with singing voices, but nothing approaching Suno’s vocals). If you need sung lyrics, Magenta isn’t the right tool. Another drawback is that using Magenta’s library requires some technical skill (coding or using pre-built interfaces). It’s powerful for those with music and programming background, but not a plug-and-play solution for a casual user wanting a finished song. When to Use Magenta Over Suno: Use Magenta when:
You want greater compositional control and plan to be in the loop. For instance, if you are composing a piece and want the AI to generate 8 bars of melody that you will then arrange and polish, a Magenta model is ideal. It’s like having an AI assistant suggest musical phrases rather than making an entire production.
You are focusing on instrumental music or need new sound design for instruments. E.g., generating unique synth sounds via NSynth, or creating variations of a melody for a string quartet.
Integration into a DAW or workflow: Magenta outputs MIDI, which can be imported into any Digital Audio Workstation to assign virtual instruments and edit. If you prefer controlling mixing and production yourself, Magenta gives you just the raw material.
Real-time performance or installation: Some Magenta models can run in real-time for interactive music systems (like a muse that plays along with you). Suno, being a text-to-music system, isn’t geared for live interaction or responding to a musician’s input on the fly.
In summary, Magenta is suited for composers and developers who want building blocks and inspiration, whereas Suno is for those who want a complete song generated from descriptive text.
ElevenLabs (Voice Generation)
Overview: ElevenLabs is an AI text-to-speech platform known for its extremely realistic voice synthesis. It specializes in spoken audio (from narration to character voices) rather than full music, although clever users have made it sing short phrases. The core features include a set of pre-made high quality voices and the ability to clone a voice from a sample. It supports multiple languages and emotional intonations in speech. Prompting Strategy: Prompting ElevenLabs is straightforward: you input text that you want spoken. The system will read it in the selected voice. There is no separate concept of “style of music” or instrumentation – it only outputs voice. However, there are strategies to manipulate the speech delivery:
Use punctuation and formatting to influence cadence. For example, adding commas, ellipses “…” or line breaks can introduce pauses. Exclamation points or question marks can change intonation. Writing in all caps can make the voice speak louder or with urgency.
Phonetic spelling or SSML (if supported) can be used to ensure correct pronunciation or even to make the voice sing. SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags allow control over prosody (pitch, rate, volume). ElevenLabs has a proprietary way to adjust “stability” and “clarity” of the voice output via its API, which can inject more or less emotional variability.
To attempt singing, some users feed lyrics with musical notation or cues (like adding “♪” symbols or writing out elongations like “loooove” for a sustained note). ElevenLabs wasn’t built for singing, but a monotonic melody can sometimes be approximated by carefully spacing syllables and adding punctuation. Still, results are limited – it might carry a tune for a very simple melody, but mostly it sounds like spoken word that has a bit of a sing-song cadence.
Strengths: ElevenLabs shines in generating human-like speech. Its voices are highly natural and fluent with proper inflection. Strengths include:
Voice Cloning: With a few minutes of audio of a target voice, you can create a custom voice that sounds like that person (for example, cloning your own voice or a character’s voice). This is extremely useful if you need a specific narrator or want to maintain a consistent voice across different texts.
Multilingual & Same Voice: ElevenLabs can take a single voice and have it speak many languages, even ones the original speaker doesn’t speak. The AI transfers the voice qualities to other languages. This is useful for multilingual narration – e.g., a single character in a story could speak English, French, and Japanese lines with the same voice tone
facebook.com
.
Emotion and Clarity Controls: Through their API or voice settings, you can adjust a stability slider. Lower stability means the speech has more expressive variation (which can sound emotional or dramatic), whereas higher stability yields a steadier delivery. This is not fine-grained like saying “make it happy or sad,” but it does allow some emotional coloring.
High Quality Output: The audio from ElevenLabs is 44.1kHz high fidelity speech with almost no artifacts. It’s ready to use in professional settings (audiobooks, game dialogue, etc.) with minimal cleanup.
Weaknesses: As a pure TTS, ElevenLabs does no music or background sound. If you need singing, it’s not trained for that (pitch is not explicitly controlled via notes). It also doesn’t compose or generate instrumentals – so it’s not an AI songwriter, just a voice. Also, it’s a proprietary service – there is a cost for usage beyond a free tier, and you rely on their API or web interface (there is no offline model available publicly). Another consideration: voice cloning can raise ethical issues if used improperly (cloning someone without permission), whereas Suno avoids specific voice copying. From a prompting perspective, you might find it challenging to make the voice performance truly musical – it won’t automatically do vibrato or hit specific notes because it doesn’t understand musical notation in the prompt (it reads any input as spoken text). When to Use ElevenLabs Over Suno: Use ElevenLabs when:
You need a narration or voiceover. For example, if your project is an audio story, podcast, or video game and you need characters to speak scripted lines very convincingly, ElevenLabs is ideal. Suno cannot do long-form spoken dialogue with the same natural clarity (its focus is singing in songs).
You want to generate vocals to overlay on music manually. If you have a backing track (maybe generated by Suno or composed yourself) and you want a specific voice to sing or speak lyrics over it, you could try using ElevenLabs to recite the lyrics and then match that to the music. This works best for spoken word or rap, where exact pitch is less critical. For singing a precise melody, it’s not reliable. But some creators use ElevenLabs to get a capella vocals with a certain timbre and then adjust timing to music.
Voice Cloning and Custom Voices: If Suno’s built-in voices/personas don’t match what you imagine (Suno doesn’t let you choose a specific voice beyond some style hints), ElevenLabs allows you to essentially design a voice. For instance, cloning your own voice to sing a song you wrote (with the help of AI) could be a creative use: Suno for the music and composition, and ElevenLabs (with your cloned voice) to perform the lyrics in your voice. You’d have to manually align the vocal to the music, but it gives unparalleled personalization.
Multi-lingual songs or content: If you want a song that has lyrics in multiple languages, Suno might struggle or have an accent in one of them. ElevenLabs could generate verses in different languages with the same voice print. You could then mix those recordings over a music bed. Essentially, for linguistic versatility or perfect enunciation in various languages, ElevenLabs is a better choice.
In short, ElevenLabs is your go-to for realistic voice needs – think of it as an AI vocalist or narrator you direct with a script, whereas Suno is an entire band plus singer that you direct with a descriptive prompt.
Meta SeamlessM4T
Overview: SeamlessM4T is a model by Meta (Facebook) AI that aims for seamless multi-modal, multilingual translation – essentially a unified system for speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech in many languages. It can take speech or text in one language and output speech in another, all within one model. It’s geared toward breaking language barriers by directly translating speech to speech (with optional text in between) across dozens of languages, and it includes an AI voice component. Prompting Strategy: SeamlessM4T is not an interactive tool where you type a creative prompt; rather, you use it by feeding it either speech audio or text. For example:
Speech-to-Speech translation: You provide an audio clip of someone speaking in Language A; the model outputs audio of the content in Language B in a synthesized voice.
Text-to-Speech (multilingual): You provide text and specify a target language and possibly a voice, it will output spoken audio. The voices are typically synthetic and might not be as natural as ElevenLabs, but they cover many languages with one system.
Speech-to-Text or Text-to-Text: It can also just transcribe or translate text, but our focus is on audio generation.
SeamlessM4T doesn’t let you choose a specific voice style per se; it has a generic male/female voice for each language (the exact capabilities depend on the implementation – some versions allow selecting a voice). Prompting in terms of creative control is limited; it’s more about content to translate or speak. There is not a concept of “describe a mood or music style” here. Strengths:
Multilingual Mastery: The greatest strength is handling many languages and switching between them. If you have a song or poem and you want it performed in multiple languages, SeamlessM4T can translate and speak it in one go. It ensures consistency in translation and pronunciation because it’s the same model doing it.
Cross-modal: It can input speech directly. Suppose you hum lyrics in English, you could use SeamlessM4T to have them spoken in Spanish, for instance (though for singing that might become monotonic spoken output). For translating existing vocals or adding multilingual vocals to a project, it’s quite powerful.
Research and Open Access: If you require an open model, Meta did release SeamlessM4T (possibly under a research license) allowing use without relying on a closed API. This means you could integrate it into custom pipelines (for example, automatically generating foreign language versions of a song’s lyrics spoken out).
Unified Model Efficiency: Instead of using separate ASR (speech recognition), translation, and TTS, it’s all in one. This reduces complexity if your application involves any combination of those tasks.
Weaknesses:
Not Music-Focused: SeamlessM4T is not specialized for singing or music at all. The voices, while clear, are somewhat plain for creative expression. Think of them as standard TTS voices that are intelligible but not particularly emotional or characterful.
Limited Emotional Range: The primary goal is accurate translation, not expressive performance. So the output may sound somewhat flat or neutral in tone, suitable for conveying information rather than drama.
Technical Integration: Using SeamlessM4T may require running a model locally or on a server with suitable hardware. It’s a bit more technical to use than a ready-made service like ElevenLabs. There may be a demo or API from Meta, but it’s mainly known in developer circles.
Voice Consistency: While it can output speech in many languages, it might use different default voices for each language. So if you wanted the “same voice” to sing French and Japanese lines, that may not be straightforward (ElevenLabs would actually do better there by cloning one voice and using it for multiple languages). SeamlessM4T might default to a French-accented voice for French, etc. It’s “seamless” in transitioning language content, but not necessarily maintaining the exact vocal tone across languages unless explicitly supported.
When to Use SeamlessM4T Over Suno: Use SeamlessM4T when:
You are dealing with multi-language content. For example, suppose you’re producing an international collaboration track and you have a verse written in Spanish and another in Mandarin. If you want an AI to perform those verses, SeamlessM4T could generate them in each language (you might still need to handle the singing aspect separately, but at least the spoken content is covered).
Translation of Lyrics or Poetry: If you have lyrics in one language and want a quick way to hear them in another language (spoken or roughly sung), SeamlessM4T can do the translation and voice output in one step. Suno doesn’t translate; it would sing exactly what you prompt, so you’d have to translate manually.
Accessibility and Dubbing: In scenarios where you have an audio (like a song or speech) and want to dub it into another language, SeamlessM4T is designed for that. For instance, translating a narration of a musical into other languages.
Research or testing of multilingual prosody: Because it’s open, you might experiment with how different languages’ lyrics sound when spoken by AI to inform how you write multi-lingual songs.
In creative music-making, SeamlessM4T is a niche tool – it’s more of a translation engine with voices. You wouldn’t choose it to create music from scratch. But it’s a valuable auxiliary tool if your sonic art crosses language boundaries or you need AI to speak/sing in languages that Suno (or your own voice) can’t handle.
Tacotron 2 / FastSpeech (Text-to-Speech Models)
Overview: Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech are examples of academic/prototype TTS (text-to-speech) models developed by Google and Microsoft respectively. Tacotron 2 (2017) is an autoregressive model that converts text to a mel-spectrogram which is then passed to a vocoder (like WaveGlow) to produce speech audio. FastSpeech (2019) and its successor FastSpeech 2 are non-autoregressive models that can generate speech much faster and allow easier control of pitch and duration. These models (and their numerous variants) underpin many modern TTS systems. They are not turnkey services by themselves, but if you are building an AI voice system, you might use Tacotron 2 or FastSpeech as components. Many open-source TTS projects (e.g., Mozilla TTS, Coqui TTS) use these or similar architectures under the hood. Prompting Strategy: Using Tacotron 2 or FastSpeech directly typically involves providing plain text or phonemes to the model. For Tacotron 2:
You feed in a text string, e.g. “Hello, how are you?” possibly with punctuation. The model outputs a mel-spectrogram gradually, and a stop token when done.
Some implementations allow hints like embedding special tokens for emotions or voice if the model was trained on multi-speaker or emotional datasets. For instance, if trained with labels, one could prompt “<angry> I am furious with you.” to get an angry tone (this requires custom training).
FastSpeech and FastSpeech 2 allow input of text plus additional features like a pitch contour or duration per phoneme if you want explicit control, but you need to supply those or have another model predict them (FastSpeech 2 supports feeding normalized pitch and energy values to control speaking style). In summary, prompting these models is more akin to instructing a TTS engine: you give text (and possibly some markup like phonetic pronunciation or tags) and you get speech audio out. Strengths:
High Degree of Control: If you have the technical skill, you can fine-tune these models on any voice dataset you have. That means you could create a custom singing or speech voice for a character, controlling accent and timbre by the training data. Unlike a service like Suno or ElevenLabs, you’re not limited by what’s provided – you can fully customize if you retrain the model.
Integration with Music by Design: You could train Tacotron 2 on singing data (there are research papers where Tacotron has been adapted for singing by conditioning on musical notes). If you go that route, you can build a model that sings given lyrics and an accompanying melody input (though this is complex). But it’s been done: e.g., Microsoft’s Melodia or other singing synthesizers build on Tacotron-like architectures.
Offline Processing: Running these models locally means you aren’t dependent on APIs, and you can generate unlimited length speech (with enough computing power). For privacy or offline projects, this is a big plus.
FastSpeech’s speed: FastSpeech can generate speech in real-time or faster-than-real-time because it doesn’t predict sequentially. This is helpful if you want to generate long narration quickly or even do real-time TTS in an application.
Weaknesses:
Complex setup: Using Tacotron 2 or FastSpeech is a development project, not an app. You need to handle model training or find pre-trained checkpoints, install dependencies, and so on. There is a learning curve in machine learning and signal processing.
Initial Training Data Needs: A pre-trained Tacotron 2 model is usually trained on a specific voice (like the LJSpeech dataset – a female voice). If you use that out-of-the-box, you have that one voice. To get another voice, you’d need to train or fine-tune on recordings of that voice. This can require at least 20 minutes to multiple hours of voice data for high quality. Similarly, FastSpeech usually builds on Tacotron’s outputs or requires training from scratch, which is non-trivial.
No Music Generation: These models won’t create background music or accompaniment. They generate a single voice track. If you need a full song, you’d have to separately create the music (maybe with Magenta or even Suno’s instrumental output) and then use Tacotron to generate the vocals for given lyrics.
Quality Tuning: Getting the best quality involves tuning the vocoder and possibly the architecture. Early Tacotron 2 had issues with some words (e.g., mispronunciations or getting stuck on certain sounds). Modern implementations have improved, but quality might still be a bit less natural than ElevenLabs for example, unless you do a lot of careful training. FastSpeech can sometimes sound more robotic out-of-the-box because it may miss some of the natural variations that an autoregressive model captures unless those are modeled.
When to Use Tacotron2/FastSpeech Over Suno: Use these if:
You are building a custom voice AI and need full control and ownership. For instance, a game developer might train a Tacotron 2 model on a voice actor’s lines to generate new lines on the fly in that actor’s voice within a game (without sending data to an external API). This way, everything is self-contained.
Voice cloning with longer form output without external services. ElevenLabs offers cloning, but if you have very specific needs (like an open-source solution or you want to avoid subscription costs for huge volumes of TTS), training Tacotron on that voice is an alternative.
Experimentation in speech or singing synthesis research. If you want to push boundaries like making an AI sing operatically with perfect enunciation, you might modify Tacotron with note inputs (as some academic projects have). Suno doesn’t let you input notes or specific melodies for the vocal – but a custom Tacotron-based model could, if you design it that way.
Combining with composing tools: For example, you could generate a melody using Google Magenta, then take the melody and align lyrics to it (manually or with an algorithm), and finally use a Tacotron variant that is conditioned on a melody to sing those lyrics. This is a complex pipeline, but it offers ultimate control – every aspect from composition to vocal performance is guided by you and AI tools at each step.
In summary, Tacotron 2 and FastSpeech are like having a DIY kit for building a virtual singer or narrator. They require assembly and tuning, but they give you the pieces to integrate voice generation into creative workflows or products where you need something very custom. In contrast, Suno is a ready-made band and singer with limited specific tweakability. Use Tacotron/FastSpeech when Suno’s “one-size-fits-many” approach doesn’t fit your specific project requirements or when you need an offline, tailor-made voice solution.
Section 3: Lyrical Craft and Emotional Design
Creating emotionally resonant lyrics is both an art and a science. This section provides guidance on constructing lyrics that truly connect, leveraging literary techniques and even subtle sound choices that influence emotion. Well-crafted lyrics combined with AI music can elevate a song from generic to truly heartfelt. Emotional Storytelling in Lyrics: Start by defining the core emotion or story you want to convey. Great lyrics often follow a narrative arc – even if abstract – that listeners can feel. For instance, a song might move from despair to hope, or loneliness to belonging. Structuring your verses and chorus to reflect this journey creates a satisfying emotional progression. Use the Verse sections to set scenes or express personal thoughts, and the Chorus to drive home the emotional core or refrain (usually the part with the highest emotional or musical intensity). For example, if writing about overcoming hardship, Verse 1 might describe the challenge, Verse 2 the struggle, and the Chorus explodes with determination and triumph. Use of Metaphor and Imagery: Employ metaphors, similes, and imagery to evoke feelings indirectly. Instead of plainly saying “I feel sad,” you might write “There’s a storm inside my chest” – a metaphor that implies turmoil. Imagery (descriptions that appeal to senses) can paint a vivid emotional picture: “The night is a painting of loss in deep blue” conveys sadness and loneliness through visual metaphor. Concrete images make emotions tangible. If the song is happy, you might invoke bright, warm imagery (sunlight, golden fields, laughter echoing). For sorrow, colder or darker images (empty rooms, winter, shadows) often resonate. Show, don’t tell: rather than naming the emotion, describe details that imply it. This invites listeners to feel it themselves. Narrative and Structure: Some of the most emotional songs tell a small story or vignette. Consider adding a narrative element: a character (often “I” as the singer) who experiences something. A simple three-act lyrical structure could be:
Verse 1: Present a situation or memory (e.g., sitting by an empty chair remembering someone).
Verse 2: Develop conflict or change (e.g., the feelings of longing intensify or recall a promise).
Bridge: a twist or realization (e.g., understanding that person’s impact, or a decision to move forward carrying their memory).
Chorus (repeated): The emotional summary (e.g., “I miss you but you live in me forever”). By the final chorus, after the bridge, the same words can hit harder because of the story context built in verses.
Providing this structure in your lyrics prompt (with section tags) helps the AI maintain the arc. You can even explicitly instruct emotional progression, e.g., add a note like “[Bridge – build emotional intensity, shift from minor to major feel]” so the AI might follow suit in composition. Phonetic Emotion – Vowels and Consonants: Interestingly, the sounds of the words themselves (independent of meaning) can influence how emotional a lyric feels when sung. Open vowel sounds like “ah”, “oh” tend to carry sadness or grandeur well when sustained, while bright vowels like “ee” can sound keen or tense on high notes
jodieoregan.com
. Front vowels (formed in the front of the mouth like “ee” [i], “eh” [e], “ih” [ɪ]) often feel lighter or happier, whereas back vowels (“oh” [o], “oo” [u]) sound darker or more mournful
jodieoregan.com
. For example, singing “you” (oo) can naturally evoke a hollow, yearning quality, whereas “we” (ee) on a high note might sound piercing or excited. 

Figure: Tongue positions for front vs back vowels (i/e = front, o/u = back). Front vowels (left) tend to sound brighter or happier, while back vowels (right) have a darker, more somber tone. Leverage this by choosing words that contain vowels matching your song’s mood, especially for long sustained notes (if known). If the climax of your chorus has a big long note, a word containing “ah” or “oh” can give a rich open sound that conveys emotion strongly
jodieoregan.com
jodieoregan.com
. Many powerful ballads, for instance, have an “oh” or “ah” at key moments (“hallelujah” – that “ah” at the end is very resonant). On the other hand, if you want a snappy, energetic feel, lyrics with short vowels and crisp consonants might work better. Consonants also play a role. Soft consonants (like L, M, N, V) can make a line flow gently – useful in a tender or melancholic verse. Hard consonants (K, T, P, D, etc.) add punch and rhythm – useful in energetic sections or to emphasize anger/excitement. For example, the line “Tear down the walls, break the silence” has hard attacks that could convey anger or determination, whereas “Hold me in the hush of night” uses softer sounds for intimacy. Be aware of alliteration (repeating consonant sounds) and assonance (repeating vowel sounds) as tools: e.g., using a lot of “s” can create a hushed, whispery texture (“silent stars”), while repeating “b” or “p” can give a percussive feel (“beats banging in my chest”). Rhyme and Resonance: Rhyme scheme can also impact emotional perception. Perfect rhymes (love/above, tears/years) can make a song feel neatly resolved and satisfying, while near rhymes or none at all might sound more raw or conversational. If you want a haunting or unresolved feeling, you might avoid ending every line in a perfect rhyme. Conversely, a strong cathartic chorus often has an easy, singable rhyme structure that feels like a resolution (a common pop structure is AABB or ABAB rhyme scheme in the chorus). Choose what serves the emotion: an unpredictable rhyme can evoke uncertainty; a solid rhyme can provide comfort or finality. Example – Crafting an Emotional Verse: Let’s say we want to write an emotionally rich verse about regret. A bland attempt might be: “I am filled with regret. I miss you so much. I wish I could go back in time.” This tells the idea but doesn’t evoke it strongly. Instead, employ the techniques discussed:
Imagery & Metaphor: “The letters I never sent gather dust on the shelf” (implies regret of unspoken words through a visual).
Phonetics: Perhaps use soft consonants and long vowels for a mournful tone: “letters” (soft ‘l’, ‘t’ is soft here, not plosive), “dust” (the ‘uh’ vowel is a neutral somber sound).
Show regret without saying “regret”: “Each page holds a silence I can’t rewind.” The metaphor of pages and silence implies things left unsaid.
Put it in a Verse structure:
“Midnight confession to the empty room,
Your ghost in every corner I find,
Letters unsent gathering dust on the shelf,
Each page holds a silence I can’t rewind.”
This verse uses imagery (empty room, ghost, letters, dust), metaphor (ghost implies memory, page holding silence implies regret), and even phonetic consideration (notice the many ‘s’ sounds: confession, house, dust, silence – a lot of soft ‘s’ and ‘sh’ which gives a hushed, sorrowful texture). It never explicitly says “I regret not telling you” but the message comes through poignantly. When given to Suno, these well-crafted lyrics will also guide the AI’s melody; likely a slow, minor key melody would suit these words. The emotional resonance is heightened by how the lyrics are constructed. Phoneme-to-Note Alignment: If you know music, you can think about aligning lyric syllables with the melody’s emotional high points:
Generally, put important or emotionally loaded words on strong beats or sustained notes. If the word “heart” is the emotional crux of a line, you might want it to land on a longer note. In AI generation, you can’t fully control this, but you can influence it by structure (e.g., making “heart” fall at the end of a line – often melody will hold the last syllable of a line).
If you anticipate a melody (say you expect Suno to do a higher note at the end of a chorus line), try to have an open vowel there. In our examples, “rewind” ends in a diphthong [ai]; in singing, likely the “i” (as in “eye”) will be the sustained part – which is actually a bright forward vowel. If we wanted a darker tone, perhaps ending on “alone” (with ‘oh’ sound) would give a more haunting ring.
While you cannot explicitly tell Suno which note to assign to which phoneme, you can rewrite lyrics after an initial generation if something sounds off. This is the iterative craft: you might listen to the AI’s output and find a certain word lands awkwardly. You can then adjust that lyric line (maybe choose a synonym with a better vowel sound or different syllable count) and regenerate or use Suno’s “Refine” if available. Over a few iterations, you can shape how the phonetic qualities align with the music. (This is analogous to a songwriter tweaking lyrics to better fit a melody – with AI, you may tweak and re-run.) Emotion through Prosody: Prosody is the combination of rhythm, stress, and intonation in speech or song. To maximize emotional impact:
Vary line lengths and stress patterns to mirror the emotional state. A frantic emotion might have a tumble of syllables (lots of words, shorter pauses), whereas a solemn emotion might use longer, drawn-out lines with fewer words (sparse lyrics that let music breathe).
Use repetition for emphasis. If something is deeply felt, sometimes repeating it drives it home (e.g., “I will wait, I will wait for you” – repetition shows conviction or desperation). But be careful of clichés; if AI tends to repeat a line too often, you can instruct it not to (see Section 4 on avoiding clichés).
Consider emotional contrast: an extremely effective technique is to contrast lyrical content with music at times (a happy tune with sad lyrics or vice versa) to create complexity. For example, a bittersweet feeling can be achieved by hopeful lyrics in a minor key or melancholy lyrics in a major, uplifting chorus. You can attempt this by the way you prompt Suno (e.g., “lyrics are sorrowful but the music is upbeat”) – some artists intentionally do this (the “dancing while crying” vibe). It creates an ironic emotional layer.
In summary, writing emotionally resonant lyrics involves careful attention to what you say (imagery, story, metaphors) and how it sounds (vowels, consonants, rhythm of syllables). By crafting lyrics with these principles and giving them to the AI, you guide the AI to produce a melody and performance that carry the intended emotion. Always review the output and refine: if the emotion isn’t hitting right, analyze whether a word choice is too weak, or a line is too verbose, etc., and adjust. Over time, you’ll develop an intuition for lyrical tweaks that make the song truly resonate.
Section 4: Avoiding Clichés and Negative Prompting
AI-generated lyrics and music can sometimes fall into predictable patterns or clichés if not guided properly. This section identifies common stereotypes in AI outputs and provides strategies to avoid them, including the use of negative prompts and other techniques to keep your creations original and engaging. Typical AI-Generated Clichés:
Lyric Clichés: AI models (trained on countless pop songs) often regurgitate familiar phrases. You might see overused lines like “tonight we feel alive,” “dancing in the moonlight,” “love is a fire burning bright,” or very generic emotional statements (“I miss you so much,” “I’ll never let you go”). Love songs might default to rain, stars, hearts, and tears in a formulaic way. Similarly, motivational songs might spew platitudes like “we can do anything if we believe.” These aren’t wrong, but they lack specificity and originality.
Chord/Melody Stereotypes: While Suno doesn’t expose chords directly, you may notice the music often gravitates to common pop progressions (like the four-chord I-V-vi-IV progression). The structure might default to verse-chorus-verse-chorus without a distinctive bridge if you don’t specify otherwise. Upbeat songs might all have a similar clap track or drum pattern that the AI found common in training data.
Arrangement Stereotypes: AI might, for instance, always add a certain reverb-heavy backing vocal “ooh” in ballads, or default to a guitar-strum pattern for midtempo pop, simply because those appear frequently in the dataset. Without specific prompting, an “AI rock song” might always produce a guitar solo after the second chorus because that’s statistically common.
Negative Prompting and Exclusions: Suno provides an Exclude Styles box (negative prompt) where you can list elements you want the AI to avoid
help.suno.com
help.suno.com
. Use this to steer clear of unwanted clichés or features:
If you fear lyrics will be too generic, you can exclude certain words or themes. E.g., put “Exclude Styles: cliché, generic pop, ‘baby baby’, ‘oh oh oh’”. While not guaranteed, this signals the model to avoid those. You can also exclude instruments or genre influences: e.g., if your “country ballad” prompt keeps getting pedal steel guitar and you don’t want it, exclude “pedal steel” or “twang.”
For music stereotypes: If every output in a genre sounds similar, try excluding the broad genre itself after specifying a more niche style. For example, if you prompt “rock” and it’s too generic, instead prompt “post-grunge raw rock” but exclude “arena rock” or “classic rock” to avoid the standard patterns.
Exclude common phrases explicitly: If the AI gave a cliche line in a draft, run again with that phrase added to exclude. For instance, Exclude Styles: “tonight is the night, forever love, broken heart” – this can reduce the chance those appear. Users have noted Suno’s exclude function helps to remove unwanted styles or phrases the same way negative prompts help in image generation

.
Avoidance Strategies (Prompt Engineering):
Be Specific and Original in Prompts: The more detail and narrative you provide (as discussed in Section 3), the less room the AI has to fill with cookie-cutter lines. For example, instead of prompting “a love song about missing someone,” prompt “a love song about a traveler crossing oceans, missing their beloved who waits by a harbor – themes of distance and reunion.” The unique imagery of oceans and harbor will push the AI away from generic nightclub or city-lights imagery.
Inject Uncommon Phrases: Deliberately include an unusual line or metaphor in your lyrics prompt. This serves two purposes: it gives the AI something novel to latch onto (reducing reliance on learned clichés), and it makes the song more distinctive. For example, one line in your prompt might be “Our memories are fossils in the backyard of my mind.” That’s not a line the model is likely to have seen often (if at all), which forces it to create original continuation around it rather than falling back on known songs.
Use Lesser-Known Genres or Mixes: If you just say “pop song,” you’ll get the most average pop. But if you say “a Baroque-pop fusion” or “trip-hop influenced R&B,” the model will try to reconcile these, often avoiding the most tired tropes of any single genre. Combining genres (genre blending) not only is creatively interesting (as noted in Section 5) but also inherently avoids some clichés because it’s exploring intersections.
Control Repetition: AI might repeat a chorus too many times or a phrase excessively, thinking it’s being an earworm. If you notice this, you can adjust prompts to prevent it. For example, explicitly write only one instance of the chorus in the lyrics prompt and mention “(repeat chorus x2)” in a note rather than writing it out – the AI might then not literally generate it three times, leaving that to you. Or use the exclude prompt to ban a line after first occurrence: e.g., if it kept repeating “We will rise” too much, exclude the exact line on subsequent generation.
Blind Spots and Issues to Monitor:
Emotionless Tone: Sometimes AI-generated lyrics, while coherent, can feel emotionally flat or generic because the AI is playing safe. If you get a result that is technically okay but not moving, it’s often because the lyrics lack personal touches or concrete details. Remedy: inject some specificity (a name, a place, a small story detail) to give it personality.
Awkward Syllable Timing: The AI might output a line that is too wordy to fit naturally in the melody, causing a rushed or awkward sung line. When reviewing Suno’s output, listen for any lines where the singer crams too many syllables. If found, simplify that lyric. For example, “In the darkest of nights I wander all alone” might sound rushed if the melody expected fewer syllables. You could change it to “In the dark night, I wander alone,” which is more succinct. This kind of editing is often needed in iterative passes.
Language Mismatch with Style: Another subtle issue: sometimes the words chosen might not fit the genre’s usual diction. For instance, extremely formal words in a casual punk song (“ineffable sorrow” in a punk chorus might feel off). The AI might not catch that nuance. As the lyricist, ensure the language level matches the style (unless deliberate contrast for effect). If you see such mismatches, adjust wording.
Overuse of Fillers: Many AI songs throw in filler syllables or vocalizations (“oh”, “yeah”, “baby”) automatically, especially in pop or rock. If these feel excessive or cheesy, you can instruct the model to limit them. For example, in the prompt, after the lyrics, you can add a note like: “Avoid filler words like ‘yeah’ or ‘uh’. Lyrics should be meaningful throughout.” The model might take that into account.
Melodic Blandness: If you repeatedly get melodies that are very plain (perhaps due to safe note choices), consider pushing the AI out of its comfort zone by specifying something like “with an unpredictable melody” or “with jazz-influenced chord changes” in the style prompt. While it may not understand perfectly, it might interpret as license to be less formulaic.
Example – Using Negative Prompt in Suno: Suppose you want to create a fantasy-themed folk song. You fear the AI might introduce clichés like “misty mountains” or “ancient prophecy” or default to a very Tolkienesque style which you want to avoid. You could write:
Style: “Medieval-inspired folk ballad with harp and flute, but unique story (not generic high fantasy).”
Lyrics: you write a unique story about, say, a shepherd who lost their flock to a mythical creature – something relatively fresh.
Exclude Styles: “elves, prophecy, chosen one, misty mountain, dragon” (to ban these overused fantasy tropes).
By doing so, you consciously steer the AI to a more original fantasy storyline rather than defaulting to what it’s seen in countless fantasy songs/stories. Another Example – Avoiding Pop Clichés: If making a modern love song but you’re tired of “tonight” and “dance floor” references:
Exclude: “tonight, baby, forever love, dancing in the club, DJ”.
And in your lyrics, perhaps set it somewhere different (like morning sunlight on a road trip). The output will likely avoid club/dancefloor imagery altogether and find other expressions.
Iterative Refinement to Combat Stereotypes: It’s rare to get a perfect, cliché-free lyric in one go. Plan to iterate:
Generate a draft with your prompt.
Analyze it: underline any line that feels trite or overused.
Edit those lines in your prompt before regenerating. You might replace them with more specific lines as discussed.
If the music arrangement felt generic, consider adding an exclude for a particular instrument that dominated or boost another instrument to change texture.
Regenerate with the refined prompt.
After a couple of iterations, you should have something that feels much more original, as the AI is being guided firmly away from its most trodden paths. In conclusion, preventing clichés in AI music generation requires proactive prompting and sometimes the use of the exclude (negative prompt) feature. By clearly telling the AI what to avoid and giving it fresher alternatives to work with, you can bypass many common pitfalls like repetitive phrasing, banal lyrics, or cookie-cutter arrangements. Always remember: the more intentional and specific you are, the less the AI will fill gaps with default content. Use negative prompts as the “guard rails” to keep the AI from steering into creative ruts, and positive prompts as the “GPS” to guide it toward novel territory.
Section 5: Creativity Enhancement Techniques
To push beyond ordinary outputs, you can employ various creativity enhancement techniques in your prompts and workflow. These techniques encourage the AI to generate novel combinations and help you iterate on ideas to produce truly unique sonic art. Genre Blending: One of the most powerful ways to get creative output is to blend genres that are not commonly combined. This leverages the AI’s training across different styles to synthesize something new. For example, prompt with “a jazz-infused hip-hop track” or “classical Baroque meets heavy metal”. Suno v4.5 handles genre mashups better than ever
suno.com
, producing cohesive music that nonetheless carries elements of both styles. The result can be surprising: a classical+metal blend might give you orchestral strings over aggressive drums, or a jazz+hip-hop might yield complex brass riffs with a rap beat. When blending, identify a primary genre and one or two secondary influences. In lyrics, you can support this by mixing vocabulary or themes from those genres (e.g., poetic language from folk with slang from hip-hop). Tip: Use the Style prompt to explicitly name the genres and even eras (e.g., “90s grunge + medieval tavern music”) and describe the instrumentation that reflects each. Genre blending often automatically avoids clichés because it’s forging a less-traveled path between styles. Conceptual Juxtaposition: Similar to genre blending but broader – combine conceptual or thematic elements that are unexpected. This could be lyrical themes or even emotional tones. For instance, “a lullaby about a robot longing for nature” or “an upbeat celebratory song about failure and learning”. These conceptual juxtapositions force the AI to reconcile conflicting or unusual ideas, leading to creative lyrics and sounds. The second example might produce ironically cheerful music with lyrics about failing – something bittersweet or tongue-in-cheek. By juxtaposing concepts (robot + nature, happy + failure), you not only get originality, but often depth: the song can operate on multiple levels (surface happiness, underlying melancholy, etc.). Prompting strategy: clearly state the two (or more) concepts you want to fuse, possibly with a phrase like “blend” or “juxtapose”. For example, “Concept: combine the innocence of a children’s lullaby with futuristic cyberpunk imagery.” This tells the AI to generate maybe a gentle melody using synth tones and lyrics about neon stars or circuit dreams – a fresh mix. Iterative Evolution of Themes: Don’t feel constrained to get everything in one prompt. Use iteration as a creative tool. For example, you can generate a base song, then feed its output (or your revised version of the lyrics) back in with tweaks to evolve it further:
Start with a simple prompt to get a basic idea (maybe a straightforward folk song).
Then think, “What if I twist this?” Perhaps now prompt Suno with the same lyrics but a different style (like turning your folk song into a synthwave version). This process of style transfer can yield interesting results – you get to hear your theme in a new light.
Alternatively, generate multiple versions of a chorus by slightly altering mood words, then pick the best lines from each to form a stronger chorus.
You can even do “exquisite corpse” style creation: generate a verse with one prompt focus, another verse with a different focus, then see if you can join them or have the AI join them via a bridging section. This can create songs that change unexpectedly (like movements in a piece).
Because Suno (and other AI) can generate quickly, you can treat them like brainstorming partners: produce many variations, cherry-pick the best ideas, then maybe prompt again combining those best bits. Phonetic and Rhythmic Play: Use creative phonetic patterns or rhythms in lyrics to give the music a unique character. For example:
Alliterative lines: “Sailing on silver seas” – repeating ‘s’ can give a soft, flowing musical quality. Or “Bouncing between broken beats” – lots of ‘b’ creates a punchy bounce. If you include such tongue-twisters or patterns, the AI’s melody might emphasize those patterns in interesting ways (percussive for the latter example, gentle and smooth for the former).
Internal rhymes and wordplay: Rappers do this often – multiple rhymes within a line. Even if you’re doing a sung genre, a line like “Hollow tomorrow I borrow sorrow” has internal rhymes (hollow/borrow, tomorrow/sorrow) that create a unique rhythm and mood. The AI might pick up on the internal rhyme and give a certain swing to that line.
Onomatopoeia and non-lexical vocables: Incorporate sound-imitating words or made-up syllables for musical effect. E.g., “tick-tock” in lyrics can mimic a clock rhythm in the song, or writing a line like “Boom, boom, clap!” could make the AI emphasize a drumbeat there. Similarly, scattering some “la-dee-da” or “tra la la” intentionally (not as a filler, but as a stylistic choice) could create a whimsical section. Mark them clearly so the AI knows it’s intentional (you could even put them in quotes or italics in the lyrics prompt to signal they are literal sounds to sing).
Syncopation hints: If you want a certain rhythmic feel, you can stagger your lyrics on the page or use punctuation to hint at syncopation. For instance:
csharp
Copy
Edit
[Verse]
I **pause** on the off-beat, 
  catch my breath on time, 
You **speak** in syncopation, 
  prose turned into rhyme.
The staggered layout (with some indenting) and the words “pause on the off-beat” may cue the AI’s internal rhythm. While not guaranteed, the model might interpret this structure as a hint to not make every line start exactly on the downbeat, thus yielding a syncopated melody.
Dynamic Contrast & Evolution: Another technique is to design the song to have distinct sections that contrast with each other (loud/soft, fast/slow, major/minor). You can encode this in the prompt:
E.g., “[Verse – slow and minor key, introspective] [Chorus – double time and major key, triumphant]”. This is like instructing the AI to switch gears. The result could be a really cool evolution: maybe the verses are moody and quiet, and then it blossoms into a big upbeat chorus. The AI is capable of changing intensity between sections if guided.
Build-up techniques: Use the lyrics and prompt to indicate build-ups (crescendo) or breakdowns. For instance, “Bridge: gradually building intensity, humming grows louder to final chorus”. Even if Suno doesn’t literally crescendo the audio, it might add layers or a key change to simulate the lift.
Genre shifting within one song: You could even attempt a song that changes genre mid-way. For example: “[Verse 1 – acoustic folk] [Verse 2 – transition to psychedelic rock feel] [Chorus – full psychedelic rock]”. This is advanced prompting; Suno might or might not handle a drastic mid-song genre shift well, but it might surprise you. Alternatively, you can create multi-part songs by generating separate segments with different styles and then manually cross-fading them.
Novel Use of Scales/Modes: If you have musical knowledge, you can ask for unusual musical scales or modes to get a different feel. For example, “Compose in Dorian mode” or “use an Arabic maqam scale for the melody” or “oriental pentatonic feel in the lead instrument.” Suno might recognize mode/scale terms (it likely knows common ones like minor, major, blues scale). Using a mode like Phrygian will lend an exotic sound, avoiding typical Western pop sound. (This is a bit experimental – results vary, but it’s worth trying if you want a specific flavor. Ensure the rest of the prompt is consistent, e.g., “a metal riff in Phrygian mode for an ominous vibe.”) Inspiration from Other Media: Conceptual art techniques can inspire unique prompts. Think of a painting or movie scene and describe it in the prompt for musical creation. E.g., “Imagine the sound of Van Gogh’s Starry Night as a song: swirling, mysterious, hopeful under the moonlight.” This isn’t a typical prompt with musical terms, but such imaginative description can lead the AI to produce a piece that feels like that painting – perhaps the melody swirls and there’s a gentle but dynamic flow. This approach bypasses clichés because you’re essentially prompting with a non-musical source of inspiration (a visual or story reference) which the AI has to interpret musically. Collaborative Iteration with AI (“Chain prompting”): You can use other AI (like GPT-4 itself or a writing assistant) to help craft more creative prompts for Suno. For instance, you could ask a language model to generate a list of unusual song concepts or metaphors, then feed those to Suno. Example:
Ask GPT: “Give me an imaginative one-line concept for a song that blends two unlikely themes.”
It might answer: “A blues song about a spaceship captain feeling homesick for Earth’s oceans.”
You then use that line as your Suno style prompt and write fitting lyrics. This chaining can break you out of your own box and essentially outsource some creativity brainstorming to AI, then use Suno to realize it in audio.
Surprise Elements: Don’t be afraid to include one wild element in your prompt. This could be a sudden instrument or a key change or a guest vocal style. E.g., “In the final chorus, introduce a gospel choir for harmony.” Or “Suddenly drop to a minimalist heartbeat sound then rise again.” These can lead to goosebump moments if executed well. The AI might not perfectly execute all surprises, but even partial attempts can be interesting (maybe it brings in an organ or something to emulate a gospel feel). The theme across these techniques is pushing boundaries: by blending, juxtaposing, iterating, and introducing unusual elements, you steer the AI away from the ordinary. The result is often music that feels innovative. Always keep an experimental mindset – not every experiment will succeed, but since generating costs only time and some credits, you have a lab for sonic experimentation at your fingertips. Combine these techniques: for instance, you might blend genres and do conceptual juxtaposition in one prompt (“a classical waltz about digital addiction”). Or iterate on a genre-blended song by introducing a new surprise element in the second iteration. Over time, you’ll develop a feel for which combinations yield magic.
Section 6: Rhythmic, Harmonic, and Phonetic Algorithms
Underlying a great song are patterns of rhythm and harmony that work hand-in-hand with the lyrics. In this section, we explore how principles of poetic meter can align with musical rhythm, and we outline some algorithmic ideas for mapping lyrical elements (vowels, consonants, syllables) to musical elements (notes, intervals, cadences). By consciously applying these principles, you can craft prompts or edit AI outputs to improve the musicality and expressiveness of the result. Poetic Meter and Lyrical Rhythm: Poetic meter refers to the pattern of stressed (strong) and unstressed (weak) syllables in lines of verse. Common meters in songwriting and poetry:
Iambic meter (da-DUM): Every second syllable is stressed, e.g., “beLONG”, “deCIDE”. Many English phrases naturally fall in iambic rhythm (think of iambic pentameter in Shakespeare – five iambs per line: “Shall I comPARE thee TO a SUMmer’s DAY?”). In songs, iambic lines often feel flowing and resolved.
Trochaic meter (DUM-da): The opposite pattern, stress on the first syllable then a lighter one, e.g., “NEver”, “BROken”. Trochaic lines can give a falling, emphatic feeling. For instance, the word “freedom” is trochee (FREE-dom); a trochaic meter might emphasize beginnings of phrases.
Anapestic (da-da-DUM) and Dactylic (DUM-da-da) meters are three-syllable patterns that can create a galloping rhythm. An example anapestic phrase: “in the DARK” (where “in the” are quick unstressed and “DARK” is stressed). Dactylic example: “HAPPiness” (HAP-pi-ness).
In songwriting, strict meter is often loosened, but stress alignment with musical beat is crucial. Rule of thumb (algorithm): Align stressed syllables of lyrics with strong beats in the measure. Strong beats in common 4/4 time are usually beat 1 and 3 (and to a lesser extent 2 and 4). If a lyric line is “I WALK through the VALley of SHADows” (stresses on WALK, VAL-, SHAD-), ideally those syllables land on downbeats or at least on the beat. This makes the lyrics naturally intelligible and satisfying. The AI generally does a decent job at this because it was trained on real music, but when writing your lyrics:
Try to write with a consistent syllabic rhythm for corresponding lines. E.g., if Verse 1 line 1 has 8 syllables with stresses on 2, 5, 8, try to have Verse 2 line 1 similar.
Count syllables and stresses (you can mark them as in poetry: I WALK (/) through the VAL (/)ley of SHAD (/)ows (/) – four stresses). Ensure a similar pattern for the next line if the melody repeats.
If you find the AI’s singing sounds off-rhythm, you can adjust lyrics to better fit a meter. For example, if a line has an extra syllable throwing off the meter, drop a filler word or find a contraction. Conversely, if a line is too short, add an interjection or elongate a word (e.g., “ever” to “evermore”) to fill the gap. Mapping Vowels to Notes or Intervals: Vowels carry the vocal tone – different vowels might be strategically placed on different types of notes:
High Notes Prefer Open Vowels: As discussed in Section 3, open vowels like “ah” [a] or “oh” [o] are easier and more resonant on high sustained notes
jodieoregan.com
jodieoregan.com
. An algorithmic approach: if you have a melody and lyrics, ensure any note that is, say, in the top 20% of the singer’s range coincides with a syllable that has an open vowel. In practice with AI, you could ensure your highest emotional word has a suitable vowel. For example, if the climax note falls on the word “me” (with vowel [i]), consider altering that word to “mine” or “heart” or something with [a] or [ɑ] which might sound fuller up high.
Intervals and Word Emotion: Some songwriters map character of interval to lyric. A large leap (like a perfect fifth or octave) might be paired with a word of significance or a open vowel to make it stand out. A stepwise motion might carry connector words. This is granular, but if you notice the AI gave a big leap on an inconsequential word, you might rephrase so that the leap occurs on a weighty word. For instance, if the melody leaps on the word “the” (which is unstressed and meaningless by itself), you might adjust the lyric to push a meaningful word into that spot.
Repetition of Notes and Vowels: If a melody repeats a note or has a motif, you can enhance memorability by matching a rhythmic or vowel motif. E.g., if the melody goes C-C-C (three repeated notes) and your lyric syllables there are “con-quer-ing,” you have “con” on first C, “quer” on second, “ing” on third. Perhaps not ideal as the vowel changes each time (o -> er -> i). If instead you had “fire-fire-fire” on those three notes, the repeated word/vowel could reinforce the musical repetition. While you can’t precisely control melody, you can repeat a word or part of a word where you suspect a melodic repetition might be (like in a rhythmic chorus hook, repeating a word three times often yields a melody that also repeats or a rhythmic pattern that matches). So as a technique, intentionally repeat strong syllables in lyrics to encourage the AI to perhaps sustain or repeat notes (which often happens if lyrics repeat). This is how many hooks are written (e.g., “Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be” – the melody follows the lyric’s repetitive structure).
Consonant-Melody Alignment: Consonants, especially strong percussive ones, align with rhythm:
Percussive Consonants on Beats: Plosives like B, P, T, K are like mini drum hits. You might align them with drum beats. Algorithmic idea: if you have a snare on beat 2 and 4, maybe the lyric on those beats should start with or contain a strong consonant for a punch. Many rock songs do this naturally (lyrics accenting downbeats with hard consonants gives a driving feel). For AI prompting, you could include more of those consonants in lines that you want to be rhythmic. For example, a choppy rhythmic delivery can be aided by alliterations like “Time to take control” – the “T” sounds could fall on the beat giving a sense of attack. If your lyrics are too all-vowels and soft consonants, the song might sound more legato and less rhythmic. So decide based on genre: a rap or rock verse might benefit from plenty of consonants (especially at start of words), while a legato ballad might intentionally avoid too many hard consonants that break the flow.
Sibilance and Sustain: Sibilant sounds (S, Sh, etc.) can drag out like a cymbal hiss. If you want to convey a whispery or sustained texture, using a lot of “s” can actually complement that – the singer might naturally hold the s a bit. Conversely, too much sibilance can sound harsh if overdone. Use as a flavor: e.g., “ceaseless seas” could be a soft, extended sound fitting a calm section.
Rest and Breath: In musical phrasing, breaths or rests often come after a line or at punctuation. When writing lyrics, consider where the singer would breathe. You can insert a comma or line break there. The AI usually respects line breaks as slight pauses. Make sure your lyrical sentences aren’t so long that a breath would be impossible – even if AI can sing without breathing, we perceive phrases more naturally when they have human-like breaks. As an algorithm: limit each line to ~8-12 syllables (or whatever fits one measure or two of your tempo) then break. This inherently creates a rhythm and allows space.
Spacing and Syllabic Timing: The way lyrics are spaced (in time) impacts rhythm:
If you have many syllables crammed in a measure, that section will be rapid-fire (like rap or patter singing). If that’s your aim, great. If not, you might need to reduce syllable count or split into more measures (verses).
Use elongation for emphasis – one algorithmic trick: to indicate a syllable should be stretched, you can write it with extra letters in the lyrics prompt (e.g., “looooove” instead of “love”). The AI might interpret that as holding the note for that syllable longer. It often does, actually, because it tries to sing the word with the given spelling – elongated spelling hints at a melisma or hold. Use this sparingly and in informal contexts (it’s great for a passionate “oh” or “love” in a climax).
Repetition of words can indicate rhythm (as mentioned). For example, to get a stutter effect or a bounce, you might write “run-run-run away” or “no, no, no, not again”. The AI will likely sing “no, no, no” rhythmically. Negative prompting can remove unwanted repetition, but you can use intentional repetition to your advantage as a rhythmic device.
Syncopation: To lyrically imply syncopation (off-beat entry of words), you might start a line with a rest. In a lyrics prompt, you can’t exactly write a rest, but you can use a placeholder like “…” or even just start the line with a space or a short word like “and” if the main word is intended to hit after the downbeat. It’s a bit abstract, but consider a line like: “ …world on fire” after a previous line. The ellipsis might cause the AI to insert a tiny instrumental gap or just a timing that “world” doesn’t start immediately. At least, conceptually, you can trick the timing by how you position words in lines relative to each other.
Harmony and Cadence Rulesets: In Western music, certain progressions convey closure or tension:
Cadences: For a feeling of resolution at the end of a chorus or song, a V -> I (dominant to tonic) chord change is classic. While you cannot directly input chords, you can hint at it. For example, ending your chorus lyric on the song’s title or a strong one-syllable word often results in a melodic cadence that resolves (the model might instinctively do a falling melody or resolve to the tonic note). You could also literally mention an emotion of resolution: “(resolve)” or “finally free” at the end, which might psychologically prompt a musical resolution.
Avoiding monotony in harmony: If the AI tends to loop the same four chords, you might push it via lyrics or prompt to introduce a bridge with new chords. For example, include a line in the bridge lyrics about “change” or “shift” and in style prompt mention “bridge with a different chord progression or key change.” The model might then do something different in the bridge, addressing the monotony.
Algorithms for chord suggestion: If one uses Magenta or other tools in combination, you could plan chords separately and then use Suno’s output just as a guide track. But staying within Suno: describing the mood of harmony can influence chords. E.g., “tense, unresolved feeling in pre-chorus” could make it choose a chord that doesn’t resolve at the end of that section, leading to a satisfying resolution in the chorus. Use emotional or functional language: “a hopeful lift in the chorus” might equate to a key change up or a switch from minor to major.
To formalize a bit, imagine a pseudo-code to adjust lyrics for better alignment:
csharp
Copy
Edit
for each lyric_line in song:
    stresses = identify_stressed_syllables(lyric_line)
    if not aligned_with_downbeats(stresses):
        adjust_line_meter(lyric_line)
    if lyric_line is end_of_section:
        if section is resolving:
            end_word = choose_open_vowel_word(lyric_line)
        else if section is tense:
            end_word = choose_word_with_question_or_unresolved_sound(lyric_line)
In plain terms: ensure stressed parts of the lyric line up with important beats; if a section should feel resolved, end on a open vowel or a word that sounds conclusive (often words ending in long vowels or m/n can sound closing), if unresolved maybe end on a word that suggests continuation or has a rising intonation (questions often do this). Syllabic Timing and Perceived Rhythm: The quantity of syllables per beat can dramatically change the feel:
A melody that has one syllable per beat feels steady and hymn-like.
Two per beat (eighth notes) gives a bit more energy.
Four per beat (sixteenth notes) feels urgent or rap-like.
Varying this within a song can create interest (e.g., a slow-paced verse with long syllables, then a double-time pre-chorus with many syllables to build excitement).
You can control this in lyrics by word length and count:
For a section you want slower: use fewer, longer words. Possibly even stretch a short phrase over a line by adding pauses or drawn-out words.
For a section you want faster: use many short syllable words, maybe string them without needing pauses. Example, a rapid-fire line: “Lightning strikes, hearts ignite, burning bright, alive tonight” – lots of one- and two-syllable words back-to-back will force a quick delivery, boosting energy.
Melodic Phrasing and Lyric Breaks: Consider melodic phrasing as you write. Many melodies have a call and response within a verse (two-bar phrase, then another two-bar phrase answering). You can mirror that with lyrical phrasing:
Write in phrases rather than complete sentences spanning the whole verse. E.g., break one sentence into two lines so that there’s a natural breath/space.
If you want a hook at a certain point, you might isolate a catchy phrase. E.g., at the end of a chorus, you might just put “On and on.” as its own short line. Melodically, the AI might give that a distinct motive (maybe a repetition or a standout rhythm) making it hooky.
By applying these rhythmic and harmonic “rules” consciously, you improve the synergy between lyrics and music. While the AI handles a lot automatically, these are tools you can use to fine-tune the outcome:
After generation, identify if any lyric feels off-beat or any melody feels mismatched to the lyric stress. Then adjust lyrics accordingly and regenerate or ask for variations.
If a melody feels boring, consider if the lyrics are too metrically uniform – maybe add a syncopated line or an extra syllable to shake it up (or vice versa).
Use the ideas of meter to troubleshoot awkward spots: e.g., “This line sounded crammed” – maybe it had an extra unstressed syllable that threw off the stress pattern. Remove or shorten a word to fit the pattern.
Ultimately, thinking like both a poet and a composer – aligning the prosody (natural linguistic rhythm) with musical rhythm and harmony – yields a much stronger song. With practice, you can anticipate how lyric adjustments might change the AI’s melody, essentially “coding” the desired musical outcome into the lyric prompt itself. This is a powerful approach to co-writing with AI.
Section 7: Neuroscience & Emotion
Why does a certain chord progression give us chills? How can a lyric move someone to tears? Understanding some core findings from neuroscience about how sound and language affect the brain can help inform how we prompt AI to create emotionally rich content. In this section, we connect brain science to practical techniques for Dimmi++ (and you as the creative) to generate music and lyrics that resonate deeply. Music and the Brain’s Reward System: Studies have shown that listening to pleasurable music activates the brain’s reward circuitry, notably causing dopamine release in areas like the striatum (part of the limbic system)
imotions.com
. This is similar to other rewarding stimuli (like delicious food or social affection). Peak emotional moments in music (like the crescendo into a powerful chorus or a surprising harmonic resolution) can trigger this dopamine rush. This is often associated with the sensation of “chills” or goosebumps. The implication for creation: if you want your AI-generated song to really hit, think about where that peak emotional moment is. Often it’s the chorus or a bridge-climax. Structurally, you might build up to a drop or big change – e.g., instruct the AI for a “soaring chorus” or a “climactic guitar solo that resolves the tension.” The anticipation and release pattern (tension buildup then resolution) mirrors what causes the dopamine surge
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. So in lyrics, you could build tension (lyrics expressing yearning, unresolved questions) and then resolve (lyrics finding answers or hope) at the musically intense part. Emotional Contagion and Vocal Cues: Humans are wired to detect emotion from voice tone – a sad voice vs a happy voice triggers empathy. When AI generates sung vocals, certain qualities (timbre, intonation, vibrato) will evoke emotions. Neuroscience finds that the amygdala (emotion center) responds to emotional sounds, including music
imotions.com
. For instance, a minor key melody with a slow, descending pattern can evoke sadness akin to how a sad speech intonation might. To leverage this:
Prompt for vocals with emotional descriptors: “soulful, longing vocals” or “raw, raspy angry vocals.” The AI will attempt to imbue the voice with those qualities, which listeners’ brains interpret emotionally (a raspy strained voice might convey pain or passion, engaging empathy regions).
Use melodic intervals known for emotional quality: A small detail – a minor third interval is often associated with sadness (interestingly, the minor third is found in the speech intonation of sad people across cultures – sometimes called the “sad call” interval). You can’t directly set intervals in the prompt, but you can mention “bluesy” or “minor key” which typically uses minor thirds a lot. On the flip side, major chords and major key melodies are processed as happier (though context matters).
Mirror neurons theory suggests that when we hear a voice expressing emotion, our brain mirrors that feeling. So the authenticity of expression matters. Encourage the AI to exaggerate emotion a bit: e.g., “with heartfelt, trembling voice” might lead to a vocal that triggers more response in a listener’s brain than a flat delivery.
Imagery and Memory Triggers: The hippocampus and other memory centers in the brain connect music with personal memories. A single lyric line or a sound can trigger a flash of memory or nostalgia if it’s associated with something. While you can’t tailor to each listener’s life, you can use universal or archetypal imagery that many people have some association with (sunsets, lullabies, first love, the smell of rain, etc.). Also, musical styles themselves carry collective memories (for example, a 90s synth sound might make listeners recall that era). If you want an emotional nostalgic effect, consider prompting the AI with a style from a certain decade or using “nostalgic tones”
suno.com
. The neuroscience here is that music from one’s youth often has heightened emotional encoding; so a piece that sounds vintage might evoke that stored emotion in a listener. In practical terms: “evoke 1980s power ballad nostalgia” as part of prompt can guide the AI to use instrumentation (like a certain synth or reverb) that flips those memory switches in the audience. Rhythm and Bodily Response: Rhythm in music can synchronize with our body (heartbeat, breathing, motor system). The motor cortex gets activated by rhythmic music
imotions.com
, which is why a strong beat makes you tap your foot unconsciously. Faster tempos and strong percussive beats can energize (increase heart rate, adrenaline), while slow, gentle rhythms can calm (engaging parasympathetic response). So, decide what physical/emotional state you aim for:
For energizing or empowering songs, prompt for an upbeat tempo, strong drumline. The brain will likely respond with increased arousal, making the emotion more intense (joy, excitement).
For calming or melancholic songs, choose a slow tempo, perhaps a repetitive, soothing pattern (like a lullaby or calm heartbeat-like rhythm). This can actually induce a mild meditative or soothing neural response (some studies show slow music can reduce stress hormone levels).
If you want to specifically tap into the brain’s pleasure via rhythm, consider syncopation carefully. A slightly syncopated rhythm adds surprise (the brain enjoys a bit of the unexpected, it’s an “aha” when the pattern resolves). Too much unpredictability might confuse, too little bores. Finding that balance is key to engaging the listener’s attention (neuroscientifically, this is related to prediction and reward – when a pattern is established then playfully violated and resolved, the brain rewards it).
Linguistic Processing and Lyrics: Lyrics are processed in the brain’s language areas (like Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas in the left hemisphere), but their emotional meaning also ties into the right hemisphere and limbic system. The interplay of lyrics and music can deepen emotional impact. A poignant lyric in a powerful musical setting can activate multiple networks: language comprehension, empathy, auditory aesthetics. Techniques:
Concrete language to activate sensory cortex: Descriptions like “your fingers through my hair” might activate somatosensory imagery in the brain of the listener (they feel it). “Thunder in my chest” might spark a visceral response. Engaging multiple sensory areas through lyrics creates a fuller brain activation, often making the experience more immersive and emotional.
Emotional language: Words themselves carry emotional weight – “lonely”, “home”, “freedom”, “goodbye” etc., can trigger emotional schemas in the brain. Don’t overuse on-the-nose words, but a well-placed emotional keyword can resonate. If a song’s climax lyric literally says “I still love you”, that might hit a listener who’s experienced that sentiment. Use such words at focal points for maximum effect.
Repetition and sing-along factor: The brain likes patterns. A repeated catchy lyric (like a simple chorus line) encourages the listener’s brain to participate (mentally singing along engages memory and motor planning areas). That participation can enhance emotional investment. So if appropriate, have a repeated refrain that’s easy and emotive – it will stick, and with it the emotion sticks too.
Spatial Audio and the Brain: (More in Section 8, but a note here) – Our auditory system has evolved to parse sounds in 3D space. Utilizing stereo or spatial elements can influence emotional response. For example, a sound that “moves” left to right can create a sensation of being enveloped, which might excite or disorient (for creativity, you might prompt something like “panning synth arpeggios that circle around the listener”). Echo and reverb tap into how we perceive space – a large reverb might evoke awe (like being in a cathedral) which can correlate with a sense of grandeur or loneliness. A dry, close-up vocal feels intimate, triggering feelings of closeness or vulnerability (the brain almost feels the singer is near, engaging social/emotional circuits). So think: do I want the listener to feel like in a wide space (perhaps prompting awe), or very close to the singer (perhaps empathy)? You can include hints: “intimate dry vocal” vs “grand cavernous sound”. Mirroring Emotion in Creation: Interestingly, as the creator (with AI), if you infuse genuine emotion into the prompt (via the words you choose, the scenarios you imagine), some of that carries through. There’s an element of the Turing test of emotion – even though AI doesn’t feel, it mimics patterns from humans who did feel. The more you guide it with emotionally rich input, the more likely the output triggers emotional brain responses in listeners. In essence, pour authentic feeling into what you write, and the AI will amplify it with music. Neurological Feedback for Future Tech: (Looking forward a bit – also Section 9) – There are experiments where EEG (brainwaves) or physiological signals from a listener could feed back into music generation in real time, creating an adaptive emotional loop. While that’s beyond current Suno, it might be a future dimension: imagine the system adjusting the music if it detects the listener’s attention dropping or emotional response waning, much like a DJ reading the crowd. For now, we rely on knowledge of general responses to craft songs that likely evoke the desired response in most people. In summary, some neuroscience-informed guidelines for emotional design:
Use anticipation and release (the brain loves payoff after tension).
Leverage vocal emotion and human-like expression (engage our social brain).
Activate multiple sensory and memory pathways through vivid lyrics and nostalgic or significant musical cues.
Align the song’s rhythm and intensity with how you want the body to feel (relaxed vs excited).
Consider spatial and timbral qualities that subconsciously influence mood (bright vs dark sounds, close vs distant mix).
Aim for authenticity and specificity, as the brain can tell the difference between a generic statement and one that triggers a personal association.
By designing songs with the brain in mind, Dimmi++ can purposefully guide AI to create pieces that aren’t just heard—they’re felt. The ultimate goal is to achieve that magical moment where the listener gets chills or tears up or beams with joy, because the music and lyrics together struck the right neural chords.
Section 8: Advanced Sound Design & Spatial Audio
Creating an immersive sonic experience involves more than melody and lyrics – it’s also about the textures, layers, and spatial placement of sounds. In this section, we focus on how to prompt for complex soundscapes, use spatial audio concepts, and blend ambient sounds or Foley (everyday sound effects) into musical pieces to produce a rich, three-dimensional audio experience. Layered Soundscapes: When aiming for a layered sound, think of the audio in terms of foreground, mid-ground, and background:
Foreground might be your lead vocal or lead instrument (the main melody or lyric).
Mid-ground could be accompaniment instruments (chords, bassline, harmonies).
Background can be ambient sounds, pads, or effects that fill the space and give context (like wind, crowd noise, or a consistent drone).
To prompt for this, explicitly mention multiple layers and their roles. For example:
“Compose a track with a gentle ambient drone in the background, soft piano and strings in the mid-ground, and a slow flute melody in the foreground.”
This tells the AI to allocate sonic space to each. Another example for a bustling scene:
“Layer city street noises under a jazzy hip-hop beat: background of distant traffic and chatter, mid-ground lo-fi piano chords, foreground a smooth rap vocal.”
Even though Suno is music-focused, including environmental sounds (traffic, rain, birds, etc.) in the prompt often does result in those sounds being present or at least synthesized as part of the ambience (Suno’s model has been known to integrate non-musical audio cues when given in the lyrics or style prompt with asterisks). Spatial Movement: To create a sense of movement or 3D space in the audio, describe how elements pan or move:
Use words like “left”, “right”, “distant”, “close” in your descriptions. E.g., “a call-and-response between guitars (one panned left, one panned right)” or “voices echo as if circling around the listener.” While the model doesn’t guarantee precise panning, it does have stereo output, and these cues can influence the mixing. Suno v4 and above produce stereo sound, so there is a concept of left-right in the generation. Including panning instructions (especially common ones like left/right separation) can lead to a mix where, say, dual guitars or dual vocals are separated in stereo field.
Another technique: use the Exclude Styles or prompts to avoid everything being center. For instance, if you said “immersive surround feel” in the style prompt, the AI might add reverb and stereo widening to simulate that.
If you specifically want a moving sound (like an object flying by with Doppler effect, or a sound that starts close and goes far), you might describe it narratively: *“the sound of a train rushing from the distance on the
Section 8: Advanced Sound Design & Spatial Audio
Creating an immersive sonic experience involves more than melody and lyrics – it’s also about the textures, layers, and spatial placement of sounds. In this section, we focus on how to prompt for complex soundscapes, use spatial audio concepts, and blend ambient sounds or Foley (everyday sound effects) into musical pieces to produce a rich, three-dimensional audio experience. Layered Soundscapes: When aiming for a layered sound, think of the audio in terms of foreground, mid-ground, and background:
Foreground might be your lead vocal or a solo instrument carrying the melody or main motif.
Mid-ground could be accompaniment instruments (guitar strums, piano chords, percussion) and secondary vocals.
Background can be ambient sounds, pads, or effects that fill out the atmosphere (like a faint synth drone, nature sounds, or reverb tails).
To prompt the AI for this, explicitly mention multiple layers and their roles. For example: “An atmospheric track with rain and thunder in the background, a soft piano and string pad in the mid-ground laying down warm chords, and a haunting vocal humming a melody in the foreground.” This level of detail signals the AI to allocate sonic space to each element. Another example: “Create a bustling soundscape: background layer of city street noise and faint subway rumble, mid-ground funky bass and drum groove, and foreground saxophone riffs echoing as if between buildings.” Suno will attempt to integrate these described layers. Using asterisks for sound effects can help (“rain sounds, crowd chatter”), as Suno recognizes those as non-musical audio cue

】. Essentially, treat your prompt like you’re instructing a mix engineer or film sound designer, specifying what elements should be present and at what intensity or position. Spatial Movement & Stereo Imaging: To create a sense of space and motion in the audio, include descriptors for panning and distance:
If you want instruments or vocals to appear from one side, mention it: e.g., “a guitar on the left channel answers a piano on the right channel in each verse.” The AI may not perfectly pan as specified, but it will get the idea to differentiate those instruments (Suno’s stereo output often places different sources across the stereo field).
To suggest a moving sound, you can narrate it: “a siren that starts faint and distant, then swells as it approaches and passes by from left to right.” The model might incorporate a Doppler-like increase and decrease in volume/pitch for the siren. While not guaranteed, such vivid spatial language can lead to dynamic panning or volume changes in the output.
Use words like “distant, near, echoing, surround, whisper in ear”. For example, “distant thunder rolls (background), close-up whispered vocals (foreground) panned slightly right for intimacy.” If the model was trained on binaural or stereo music with such cues, it might emulate the effect (whisper might be very present and dry on one side, thunder with heavy reverb in the back).
Reverb and space: You can indicate the type of space via reverb descriptors: “cavernous echo” implies a large hall reverb, “dry and intimate” implies little reverb, making sound appear close. E.g., “Verse vocals are dry and intimate (as if right next to the listener’s ear), but the chorus has a cavernous echo, like singing in a vast hall.” Suno will likely make the chorus vocals more reverberant and spaced out compared to the verse.
Ambient Sound Integration: Including ambient or Foley sounds can turn a song into an immersive audio scene. Suno’s model can blend certain ambient noises if prompted:
Nature sounds: e.g., “Include gentle forest ambience with rustling leaves and birds throughout,” or “the song starts with ocean waves and gull cries, forming a rhythm.” These can either be embedded via lyrics (in asterisks) or described in the style prompt. The model might literally incorporate wave-like sounds or leave space for those noises.
Foley (everyday sounds): If you want, say, a typewriter clicking in rhythm, you could prompt “typewriter key clicks as percussion,” or “a heartbeat thump as the kick drum.” The AI may emulate a rhythmic click or thump reminiscent of those sounds. For instance, a “heartbeat” might lead to a low thud at a steady 60-80 BPM, enhancing emotional gravity.
Synthetic ambiences: You can also request abstract sound design elements: “a low ambient hum (like an engine drone) underlying the track,” “wind chimes tinkling occasionally in the background,” etc. These give texture. Suno being primarily a music model might interpret some of these creatively; a “drone” could be a synth note, “wind chimes” might be high piano or bell notes sprinkled. The point is, the prompt encourages the model to think beyond typical instruments.
To ensure these sounds come through, it can help to set the scene in the lyrics if appropriate: for example, as a short intro verse:
txt
Copy
Edit
[Intro] 
*Nighttime forest: crickets sing in the distance* 
Then the actual music starts. In many outputs, Suno will indeed start with some quiet cricket-like sound pattern before instruments.
Immersive & Surround Effects: While Suno outputs stereo (not true surround sound), you can mimic a surround feel by how you prompt:
Envelopment: Words like “surrounding”, “all around”, “immersive 360 sound” might encourage the AI to use reverb and stereo spread such that elements feel around the listener.
For example: “Make the chorus sound like a choir surrounding the listener in a cathedral” — the AI could respond with wide-panned choral ahhs with heavy reverb, which gives an enveloping impression.
Movement: If you want continuous movement, describe it: “synth arpeggios pan left to right continuously, like sound waves circling,” or “the lead guitar solo sweeps from one ear to the other.” Again, not guaranteed, but the AI might incorporate a panning LFO effect or simply alternate stereo positioning between phrases.
Examples of Spatial Prompting:
An immersive ambient track: “Create a meditative soundscape in a rainforest. Background: steady rainfall and occasional distant thunder. Mid-ground: a slow droning synth chord that morphs over time, and soft tribal percussion panning gently left and right like rustling undergrowth. Foreground: a few sparse piano notes echo, each like a drop falling into a puddle, with long reverb tails.”
Result: you’d likely get a calming piece with raindrop-like piano, a constant pad, nature sounds, and a wide stereo field (thunder might rumble in the back, percussion might not be static in one place).
A live-concert feel: “Simulate a live arena performance: background crowd cheers and claps especially audible at intro and end, mid-ground reverb-heavy electric guitars and drums (as if on a big stage), foreground a powerful vocal but slightly echoey as it’s in a large venue. Include a brief crowd singing along in the final chorus for that live energy.”
This prompt pushes the AI to add a crowd ambiance. Suno might add a stadium reverb to everything and even incorporate a distant chorus of voices in the final chorus (as it’s seen examples of crowd singalongs in live music data).
Combining Music with Foley Rhythmically: You can also make Foley elements part of the rhythm:
e.g. “Use the sound of a clock ticking as part of the beat” – the AI might literally put a tick-tock sound on the beats, or mimic it with a hi-hat.
“Footsteps crunching on snow set the tempo at the start” – it might begin with a crunch-crunch that defines the BPM.
These kinds of prompts turn ordinary sounds into musical components. It’s akin to making the environment an instrument.
Caveats and Post-Processing: Suno’s primary function is music, so while it can include ambient noises, sometimes the fidelity or authenticity of those sounds might not be perfect. If the exact sound effect is crucial, you might get a better result by generating a track and then manually adding a high-quality sample of that sound in post-production. However, having the AI generate a rough version integrated is still useful for concept and timing. You can always layer real Foley later if needed, using the AI’s output as a guide. Spatial Audio Future: As a supplemental note, while Suno is stereo, one could imagine future integrations with spatial audio engines. In current practice, you could take Suno’s stems (like if you have access to separate vocal and instrument tracks via the “Covers” or “Personas” features in v4) and then position them in a 3D audio tool (e.g., make the vocal sound like it’s coming from directly in front, instruments around). Some producers are already experimenting with taking AI-generated content into Dolby Atmos mixing environments. So think of Suno’s output as a starting point – you can always spatialize it further. The prompt however lays the groundwork by telling the AI to give you the content in a way that’s amenable to spatial effects (like containing those environmental elements or leaving “space” for them). In summary, to achieve immersive audio with AI:
Be explicit about ambient sounds and effects in your prompt (use asterisks for actual sound cues).
Describe the space and distance of each element (foreground vs distant, left vs right, etc.).
Use evocative language for movement and environment so the AI’s internal composition process attempts to recreate that experience.
Don’t hesitate to get cinematic in your prompt description – you’re essentially directing an audio scene, and the AI is the Foley artist, composer, and mixing engineer following those directions.
By doing this, Dimmi++ can coax the AI into producing not just a song, but an immersive world of sound – which is especially powerful for projects like game audio, virtual reality experiences, concept albums with storylines, or simply songs that transport the listener to a place and time.
Section 9: Supplemental Future Enhancements
Finally, let’s step beyond the current capabilities and explore speculative techniques and future enhancements that could further revolutionize sonic art creation. These ideas go beyond what Dimmi++ and current AI models can do today, but they point toward exciting frontiers. (Marked as supplemental/future-facing – these are not implemented features, but possibilities on the horizon.) EEG-Driven Music Generation (Future-Facing): It’s conceivable to use brain-computer interfaces to create music by reading a creator’s brainwaves (EEG signals) and translating emotional or cognitive states into musical prompts. In the future, a songwriter could “think” of a mood or recall a memory, and an AI might detect patterns corresponding to that state and generate music to match. For example, a relaxed alpha wave pattern might prompt ambient calm music, while erratic patterns might trigger intense, chaotic compositions. An interesting supplemental idea: Dimmi++ could one day incorporate an “Emotion to Sound” converter, where a user wearing an EEG headset simply visualizes a scene or feeling, and the system generates a raw musical sketch of it. The user’s live emotional feedback (detected via EEG) could even adjust the music in real-time – a feedback loop between brain and sound. This is highly experimental, but initial research has shown correlations between EEG features and emotional music preferences. Real-time MIDI Feedback Loop (Future-Facing): Imagine an iterative jam session between human and AI. For instance, real-time MIDI generation and response: a human plays a few notes on a MIDI keyboard, the AI continues the riff or responds with a harmony, the human reacts to that, and so on in a tight loop. This would require the AI to generate music with near-zero latency. Future Dimmi++ enhancements might include a “MIDI Jammer” mode where the AI is essentially an accompanist that listens (through MIDI input or even audio input) and instantly generates complementary music. Some building blocks exist (Magenta’s AI Duet, etc.), but integrated with Suno-style production, this could yield full-band arrangements jamming along with you spontaneously. The prompting strategy here is your playing itself – the AI adapts to speed, key, and style it detects from you. With faster models (v5 or beyond) and optimized architectures, this real-time co-creation might become feasible. Neural Feedback Loops & Adaptive Music (Future-Facing): Taking feedback further, consider a scenario where the AI monitors responses and continuously adapts the music. This could be via user feedback (like hitting a “thumbs up/down” during certain parts, which the system then learns from on the fly) or via sensors (heart rate, EEG as above, or even detecting audience reaction in a live setting). In a live performance context, an AI DJ could alter the set in real-time based on crowd energy levels (some primitive versions exist using cameras or sound level, but future ones could literally read the room’s biometric vibe). For composition, a genetic algorithm style approach could be employed: generate multiple variations of a chorus, have the user (or an automatic emotion detector) select the most compelling, use that as a “parent” to breed new variations, and iterate. This is like evolutionary music generation guided by either user preference or AI-estimated emotional impact. While currently one can manually pick outputs to refine prompts, future tools might automate that optimization loop, yielding highly-refined music tailored to a desired emotional curve. Multimodal Inspiration and VR Integration (Future-Facing): As AI models become multimodal, we might see systems where visual art, lyrics, and music co-create each other. For instance, you sketch a visual landscape in a VR environment, and the AI composes music that fits the geometry and colors of what you drew. Or conversely, the AI generates evolving visuals (like light shows or music videos) in sync with the music it’s creating, essentially doing audiovisual composition. Dimmi++ could gain a visual co-pilot that, given a song concept, generates album art or immersive visuals concurrently. The user could adjust either the visual or auditory side and the system adapts the other correspondingly (e.g., make the sky darker in the visual, and the music modulates to a minor key or adds darker synth tones). This tight integration of mediums is speculative but trends in AI indicate models understanding multiple inputs/outputs at once. Voice Cloning and Personalized Singers (Future-Facing): We already have ElevenLabs and Tacotron clones, but future Suno versions might let you upload a voice sample and have that voice sing. Imagine Dimmi++ allowing a user to clone their own voice as the singer of the AI-generated song, effectively making the AI a surrogate performer for one’s composition. This raises ethical questions, but technically, it could involve fine-tuning the vocal model on the provided voice or using a voice conversion post-process. Personalized AI singers would mean everyone can hear their song performed in their (or any chosen) voice without actually singing – a very direct merging of human identity and AI skill. Emotion-Targeted Music Therapy (Future-Facing): In a therapeutic context, Dimmi++ could eventually integrate biofeedback and AI music to help regulate emotions. For example, detecting a user’s stress via smartwatch (high heart rate, variable heart rate, etc.) and then auto-generating calming music tailored to their physiological state, gradually adjusting tempo and frequency content to slow their heart and ease anxiety. Or the reverse – if someone is lethargic, generate gradually energizing music to motivate them. This would require quick model operation and a library of known effective patterns (maybe combined with knowledge from neuroscience as in Section 7). It’s speculative, but would be a powerful personal AI “song therapist” that composes in the moment for you. Enhanced User Control and Customization (Future-Facing): On a more software level, future enhancements may give users more direct control over AI generation. Think in terms of knobs and dials for aspects of the music: a “lyrics complexity” slider, an “instrument density” knob, “melodic complexity” setting, or even toggles for “more rhyme / less rhyme” or “increase harmony vocals”. Under the hood, these could adjust model parameters or prompt templates. For instance, turning up a “Complex Harmony” knob might instruct the model (via an unseen prompt addition) to use more 7th chords or countermelodies. Suno 4.5’s prompt enhancement hints at this directio

】. In the future, you might not need to cleverly word everything; instead, you paint a broad stroke (e.g., make it more upbeat) with a control, and the system re-prompts or re-mixes the piece accordingly. Collaborative Networks and Community Iteration (Future-Facing): Going beyond individual use – one could imagine a networked version of Dimmi++ where multiple users and AIs collaborate in a shared space. For example, a virtual studio where one AI handles percussion, another handles melody, and a human handles lyrics, all feeding into each other under a coordinating agent. Changes one contributor makes ripple to the others. A community could even engage in iterative creation: one person generates a baseline, publishes it; another builds on top with their own prompt additions (like a musical Git repository). With version control for songs, AI could help merge “pull requests” creatively. This requires sophisticated synchronization of generative processes, but it could lead to massively collaborative AI/human albums. These future enhancements are speculative but grounded in emerging tech and creative trends. In summary (Supplemental): The future of AI-driven sonic art might involve direct brain-to-music interfaces, real-time co-creation loops, adaptive emotionally intelligent music, deeper multimodal fusion, personalized AI performers, and richer interactive controls. Dimmi++ is poised to integrate such innovations as they become viable, ensuring that as AI music generation evolves, creators have cutting-edge tools to push artistic boundaries even further. (These ideas are exploratory and not currently implemented – they serve as inspiration for what’s on the horizon.)
