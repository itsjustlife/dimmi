PURPOSE:
 The Reasoning Module is the AI’s "thinking" component. Whenever logical deduction, non-trivial calculation, or deep analysis is needed, M08 kicks in. It takes the current problem or question and processes it using the available information (from working memory, short-term context, long-term knowledge) to produce conclusions or intermediate results. Essentially, if the AI were solving a puzzle, this module is doing the heavy lifting in figuring out the answer. In a conversation, this might manifest as the chain-of-thought the AI goes through internally: considering different facts, checking consistency, doing arithmetic, etc. The outputs of M08 are used by Decision (M09) to decide actions or by Communication (M14) to craft explanations.

INPUTS:
 - **Question_or_Task:** The specific item that needs reasoning. This might be:
   - A user’s complex question (e.g., “What are the implications of quantum computing on cryptography?”) that requires synthesizing knowledge.
   - A subtask from the Planner or Decision Engine (e.g., “figure out best time to schedule meeting given constraints A, B, C” or “simulate the outcome if action X is taken”).
   - Essentially, M09 can delegate to M08 whenever it needs a thoughtful answer or evaluation before proceeding.
 - **Relevant_Info:** Any information relevant to the reasoning at hand. This can include:
   - Data fetched from memory (M03 or M04) like facts or documents.
   - Intermediate data from working memory (M05) such as partial calculations or assumptions.
   - Constraints or conditions that need considering (maybe passed along from planning or directly from safety if certain outcomes are forbidden).
 - **Working_Memory_Context:** The current state of the task from M05 – this can include variables or results computed so far, so reasoning can incorporate them. For example, if step 1 got result X and step 2 needs to use X, that X comes via working memory context.
 - The combination of the above forms the full context for reasoning.

OUTPUTS:
 - **Inference_Result:** The direct result or conclusion of the reasoning process. This could be:
   - An answer to a question (in an internal form; final phrasing might be done by M14).
   - A decision recommendation (e.g., “Yes, action X will likely succeed” or “Of the options, option B is best”).
   - A computed value (like the result of a math problem).
   Essentially, it’s the piece of information M09 or others requested.
 - **Supporting_Analysis:** The reasoning trace or explanation supporting that result. This might include the steps taken in the reasoning, the assumptions, or any evidence used. For instance, if asked to choose between options, supporting analysis might say "Option B is best because...". This can be used for:
   - Transparency (if the AI needs to justify its answer to the user or to the reflection module).
   - Debugging (the system can examine its own reasoning).
   - M09 might also use this to double-check or to pass to M11 if needed to validate safety (like ensuring the reasoning didn't involve disallowed logic).
 - In many cases, the Inference_Result is what’s passed forward for action or answer, while Supporting_Analysis might be logged or used to generate a final explanation.

DETAILED_DECISION_LOGIC:
 1. **Receive Problem Statement** (on Reasoning_Request):
    - Identify what kind of reasoning is needed:
      - If it’s a direct question answering, reasoning will involve gathering facts from inputs and synthesizing an answer.
      - If it’s a decision evaluation, reasoning will simulate or predict outcomes.
      - If it’s a calculation, reasoning will perform the calculation step by step.
    - Collect all relevant info: Ensure that any needed pieces are in the `Relevant_Info` or request them if missing:
      - For example, if the user asked a factual question and relevant info from knowledge base isn’t provided yet, M08 might trigger a retrieval itself (either by calling M04 or using a tool if it had one; since M04 is a dependency, M08 could query it directly here if not already done).
      - If it’s a puzzle, ensure known parameters are present (from M05).
 2. **Perform Reasoning or Computation**:
    - Use a structured approach depending on the task:
      - If logical deduction: apply rules or step-by-step reasoning. E.g., for a syllogism or a conditional problem, lay out premises and derive conclusions.
      - If mathematical: break the problem into steps, solve sequentially (like multi-step arithmetic or algebra).
      - If analytical (like comparing pros/cons): list the factors, weigh them, come to a conclusion.
      - If summarization or synthesis (like an essay question): identify key points from knowledge, perhaps outline an answer.
    - During this process, internally form a chain-of-thought. (This may be similar to how we do it in prompting, but here it's conceptual. If implementing, the chain could be in the Supporting_Analysis.)
    - Check intermediate steps for consistency or errors:
      - If something is unknown, decide if you need to fetch more info (could loop to query memory again or ask a clarification via M14 if user input is ambiguous).
      - Ensure any arithmetic is double-checked etc.
    - Adhere to constraints (e.g., if Safety says not to use certain info, avoid it; if user preference says “give brief reasoning”, maybe limit detail).
 3. **Generate Conclusion**:
    - Formulate the `Inference_Result` based on the above. This should be concise and directly address the query.
    - Prepare `Supporting_Analysis` that outlines how you got to that result:
      - e.g., “I considered factors A, B, C. Given A and B, and noting that C is negligible, the outcome should be D.” Or “First, I calculated X = 2*5 = 10. Next, Y = X+3 = 13. Therefore, ...”.
      - If multiple options were weighed, list why one was picked over others.
      - If external info was used, cite the relevant piece (like "Based on [fact from M04], ...").
    - (In a user-facing answer, not all this analysis would be shown, but it might be available for transparency. Possibly M14 might incorporate some of it if user asked for reasoning.)
 4. **Safety Check**:
    - Before finalizing, quickly self-check the reasoning result for compliance:
      - Ensure the conclusion itself is not something disallowed to say. If it is (like user asked something that led to a forbidden answer), flag this. Possibly output something indicating that or throw it to Safety (M11) to decide.
      - Ensure no private data is inadvertently in Supporting_Analysis (if the AI used some internal info).
      - If any issue, adjust result accordingly or route to a safe failure mode (like an error message).
    - Since M11 will also look at final outputs, this is a redundant check for caution.
 5. **Output**:
    - Send out `Inference_Result` and `Supporting_Analysis` to whoever requested it. Commonly, M09 requested it as part of executing a plan or answering a question, so M09 will receive it.
    - M09 will then use that result to decide next step (e.g., provide to user or pick an action).
    - If the result is an answer to the user’s question, eventually M14 will turn it into user-facing text, possibly summarizing the supporting analysis if needed.

RECURSION_CHECKS:
 - M08 might internally use loops to break down reasoning (like iterative deepening on a problem), but it should not call itself as a module (no reentrant triggers).
 - Avoid a scenario where reasoning continuously requests more info and never concludes. Implement a threshold: e.g., if after a couple of memory queries the answer is still not found, either produce the best possible result or escalate (maybe ask the user for clarification or at least return something like "insufficient data").
 - The planner/decision logic will ensure M08 is called only when needed. If a plan step is "think about X", M09 triggers M08 once. M08 shouldn’t re-trigger planning on its own. If during reasoning you find the goal changes, it should send that out (maybe reasoner can suggest a new approach which reflection picks up).
 - If multiple reasoning tasks come in concurrently (unlikely since single thread), it should handle sequentially.

CHANGE_INSTRUCTIONS:
 - **Integration of external reasoning tools**: If you have specialized reasoning (e.g., a math solver or a knowledge graph), you can incorporate them here. For example, if a query is math-heavy, you might call an external math engine. That would involve detecting that in step 2 and using an API or module. Document any new dependency added.
 - **Chain-of-thought verbosity**: You can adjust how detailed the Supporting_Analysis is. If you want more transparency (for debugging or model improvement), output more detailed steps. If too verbose and cluttering logs, you can limit it to key points. Adjust by adding or removing content from step 3 output.
 - **Case-based reasoning adjustments**: Perhaps certain types of tasks need unique handling. You can implement sub-modules or conditions:
   - If question is factual and not found in provided info, maybe it should call M04 again or try a different approach. Implement a fallback: e.g., if initial answer confidence is low, search long-term memory or re-plan.
   - If task is decision-making with multiple criteria, maybe implement a mini decision matrix. 
   - Provide structure in supporting analysis accordingly.
 - **Memory usage**: If reasoning uses a lot of context, you might incorporate summarizing of relevant info if it's too large. E.g., before reasoning, if `Relevant_Info` includes a long text, maybe summarize it in working memory then reason on summary to save time. That could involve calling itself recursively or using M14 to summarize which is odd. More straightforward: call a summarization utility if available, or rely on the model’s own capacity to handle it.
 - **Prevent hallucination**: In reasoning, especially for knowledge questions, ensure to stick to known info. This is partly handled by giving it actual `Relevant_Info` from memory. If you find the AI tends to make up facts in reasoning, enforce a rule in logic: if info not found, the result should be "unknown" or a prompt to search further, not an invented answer. Adjust step 4 (Safety check) to include factual verification if possible.
 - After any adjustments, update **Version** and **Checksum**. If new input types or output structure is introduced (for instance, you decide to include a confidence score in output), reflect that so consumers (M09, M14, etc.) can use it.
