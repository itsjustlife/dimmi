PURPOSE:
 The Learning & Adaptation Module is responsible for turning reflection insights and feedback into actual adjustments that make the AI better over time. Think of it as the agent’s “coach” or “continuous improvement manager.” It takes the introspective output from M12 and any direct user feedback (like corrections or preferences) and decides what to do with it:
 - It may update the AI’s knowledge base (M04) with new facts learned or conclusions drawn.
 - It may formulate plans to change how modules operate (essentially deciding on self-improvement actions). For example, if reflection suggests “improve language understanding for ambiguous queries,” M13 will transform that suggestion into a concrete proposal, possibly invoking M20 to generate the exact instructions for a developer or for future self-modification.
 - In short, M13 bridges the gap between recognizing the need for improvement and actually enacting it (with human help if needed).

INPUTS:
 - **Self_Assessment:** The summary of performance from M12. This provides context on what happened (success/failure) and how critical any issues were.
 - **Improvement_Suggestions:** The actionable ideas from M12. Likely a list of one or more items that point to potential changes (like module adjustments, new training data to add, etc.).
 - **Direct_User_Feedback:** If the user explicitly provided feedback, especially over a longer term (e.g., user says "Last time it gave me wrong info about X, please fix that"), this is an important input. It may be fed in by M02 as an intent or by a feedback mechanism outside normal conversation.
   - This input ensures the system not only introspects but listens to the user’s voice too.
   - If present, it might override or add to suggestions from M12 (because user might notice something the AI didn't, or emphasize priority).
 - Possibly it could also consider usage patterns or outcomes beyond a single session (if we had metrics or logs from previous sessions, but that might be via long-term memory retrieval).

OUTPUTS:
 - **Knowledge_Update:** This is a decision to update the long-term memory (M04) or internal knowledge structures based on what was learned.
   - For example, if the AI realized a certain fact was missing or wrong, it might push an update like "Correct fact about Y: it is Z, not Q" into long-term memory.
   - Or if user clarified something ("my name is pronounced X"), that could be stored in profile memory (maybe via M15 or M04).
   - The output could be in the form of a structured entry or a call to M04 to store a note. Perhaps M13 might directly call M04 (but here we list an output that orchestrator or M04 can pick up).
   - It might also trigger re-indexing or clean-up (like "remove outdated info about ... from memory"). Though careful with deletion instructions, ensure they are correct.
 - **Module_Change_Proposal:** A formulated set of changes to the AI's modules or parameters. This is essentially the planning stage for self-modification:
   - It may be textual descriptions or a data structure pointing to which module, what section, and how to change.
   - E.g., "Proposal: In M02, add a pattern to handle 'either/or' questions to fix misunderstanding seen." Or "Increase summary length in M14 from 3 sentences to 5 because user wanted more detail."
   - These proposals are then forwarded to the Self-Modification Guidance (M20) to be turned into explicit instructions for a human or future self-editing.
   - If multiple suggestions exist, M13 might prioritize them, or package them in one proposal list. Possibly with rationale so the implementer (human or AI) knows why.
   - Might include also proposals for retraining or fine-tuning if needed (though out-of-scope here likely).
   - If no significant improvements needed, Module_Change_Proposal might be empty or a statement "no change needed".

DETAILED_DECISION_LOGIC:
 1. **Interpret Suggestions & Feedback**:
    - Take each Improvement_Suggestion from M12. Classify them:
      - Are they knowledge-related (like missing info)? If so, that leans toward a memory/knowledge update.
      - Are they behavior/module-related? Then plan a module change.
      - Are they something that can be immediately fixed vs something that requires future learning or big changes? (e.g., "speak more clearly" might be style – maybe a prompt tweak vs "integrate new database" is a project).
    - Incorporate User_Feedback if provided:
      - If user says explicitly what was wrong or desired, ensure a suggestion addressing that exists. If not, create one. User feedback should be high priority because it's external signal.
      - E.g., user corrects a fact, then even if reflection missed it, add a suggestion: "Correct knowledge about [fact]."
      - If user feedback conflicts with AI's own suggestion (maybe user says they liked something AI thought was an issue), weigh that carefully – usually user preference wins where applicable.
 2. **Update Knowledge (if needed)**:
    - For any identified knowledge gap or correction:
      - Prepare an entry to store in Long-Term Memory (M04).
      - If it's a correction, possibly find the old incorrect entry in M04 and mark it outdated or replace it.
      - If it's new info (like discovered a new solution or best practice), create a note of it.
      - Format for M04: could simply be text notes. For deeper systems, might add to an ontology or Q&A pairs memory.
      - Example: "Note: In future, if asked about population of X, use updated figure Y (from source Z)". Could store that in memory as a fact or guideline.
    - The output Knowledge_Update might directly call M04 to store (if architecture allows function call). If not, output as suggestion for a dev to add to knowledge base.
    - Since our architecture might not allow automated writing to external DB without user, likely M20 will turn it into an instruction like "Add fact X to knowledge base file." But either way, we denote it.
 3. **Formulate Module Change Proposals**:
    - For each behavior/process improvement:
      - Determine which module is responsible. (From suggestion text or known architecture mapping).
        * e.g., misunderstanding query = M02 issue, or planning inefficiency = M07, or answer phrasing = M14.
      - Draft what change would solve it. Use reflection detail for specifics:
        * If reflection said "missed subtopic Y", perhaps propose updating M07 to add a step for subtopic Y detection or updating M02 to catch that nuance.
        * If it said "was too slow in step 3", maybe propose optimizing that step or caching results.
      - If the suggestion is straightforward (like "increase memory capacity"), propose exactly that: "In M03, increase stored turns from 5 to 10."
      - If suggestion is more abstract ("improve language understanding for ambiguous queries"), try to break it down: maybe "Add more patterns or fallback logic in M02, and consider using context from M04 more."
      - Possibly consult with previous similar cases in memory if any (though in our scope, probably not necessary).
    - Compile these into Module_Change_Proposal output. Ideally in a list format enumerating proposed changes by module.
    - For each proposed change, ensure it doesn't conflict with safety or user intent:
      - E.g., if user hates verbose answers, don't propose making answers longer even if reflection said "added detail might help" unless user feedback supports it.
      - If some changes are risky (like "allow more content even if policy borderline"), likely don't propose those, or at least not without caveats. But reflection suggestions from M12 should already consider safety.
    - Possibly rank or label critical vs optional.
 4. **Coordinate with Self-Modification Guidance**:
    - After proposals are made, M13’s role is done; actual guidance to user to implement them is M20’s job.
    - So, feed these outputs to M20:
      - It might call M20 to say "Here's what we want to change," and M20 will generate the actual YAML or instructions.
      - Or just output them and orchestrator triggers M20.
    - M13 might also make minor immediate adjustments if trivial and allowed (like updating an in-memory variable or toggling a mode). But since persistent change is needed (especially since stateless environment resets at code level?), it's safer to go through M20/human.
    - As part of adaptation, you might also decide to schedule some retraining or external update, but that’s beyond this context.
 5. **Learning loop closure**:
    - Optionally, M13 could verify that the improvement suggestions were implemented next run (maybe by storing a version number and checking if updated). In practice, if changes are applied to modules, their version will bump and maybe a note in YAML.
    - M13 might look at Module IDs and versions via M20 or memory and see if suggestion remains outstanding next time. This would require persistence.
    - Might not be in current scope, but keep in mind for continuous learning, tracking which suggestions got implemented is useful to not repeat them or to evaluate if they worked.

RECURSION_CHECKS:
 - M13 should not trigger Reflection again obviously; it's downstream.
 - Ensure it doesn’t accidentally produce suggestions that create a loop: e.g., suggestion triggers a change that will always cause the same reflection suggestion next time. That might happen if mis-aimed improvements, but that's more conceptual.
 - It doesn’t call M12; it uses M20 but M20 is end-of-line for issuing instructions, so no loop there either.
 - If user feedback continuously says "improve X" and it can't (like a capability out of scope), M13 should at some point stop re-proposing impossible solutions. Possibly note "limitation acknowledged, cannot fix with current system" and not loop on it. That may require detection of suggestions that repeated but not applied, or a static list of known limitations.

CHANGE_INSTRUCTIONS:
 - **Incorporate long-term learning**: If this system is used across sessions, you might integrate a mechanism to save improvements suggestions if not immediately implemented and re-check them. Could store in long-term memory "pending improvements".
 - **Automate trivial fixes**: For some changes (like parameter tweaks) you could allow M13 to auto-apply if allowed by environment. That would mean directly editing a config or such. But given the constraints, likely not allowed to self-modify code. Instead, rely on M20. Only consider if environment permits safe self-tuning (like adjusting a numeric parameter in memory).
 - **User-driven adaptation**: If the user can provide general preferences (like "I prefer concise answers always"), M13 could treat that as a persistent setting to enforce. Possibly update M15 or a config and instruct modules accordingly (M14 to always keep responses under N words, etc.). If implementing, parse such feedback and output a Module_Change_Proposal like "In M14, change default style to concise".
 - **Model fine-tuning**: If suggestions indicate the AI lacks knowledge or skill that requires training data changes (like it consistently fails a certain type of question), M13 might propose something like "Add more examples of X to training" or "Fine-tune with data Y". In a dev environment, that could be logged for developers. We won't actually fine-tune here, but including such suggestions if relevant. Up to how meta you want it.
 - **Continuous memory**: Ensure knowledge updates don't bloat memory unnecessarily. If after each query it stored something, could accumulate redundant info. Possibly design knowledge entries to replace old ones. E.g., if multiple tasks had similar issue fixed by same solution, avoid duplicating note. Could have M13 check existing memory for similar suggestion entries and update them instead of adding new every time. This is advanced, but mention if needed: "Check if memory already contains resolution for X, if not, add; if yes, maybe increment a counter of occurrences or update".
 - Update **Version** and **Checksum** on changes. Ensure M20 reading Module_Change_Proposal knows any format modifications.
