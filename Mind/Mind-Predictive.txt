"Predict & Plan 2.0" Multi-Step Processing Engine
========================================

The Cognitive Orchestration Framework (P&P 3.0)

Section 1: The Cognitive Orchestration Framework (P&P 3.0): An Overview

1.1. From Linear Planner to Cognitive Architecture

The Predict & Plan (P&P) 3.0 framework represents a fundamental architectural evolution of the dimmi system, moving beyond the linear, procedural model of its predecessor, P&P 2.0. The previous version operated as a tool-based, multi-step processing engine, executing a statically generated plan in a sequential pipeline: outline, iterate, assemble. This approach, while effective for structured, predictable tasks, lacked the adaptability and resilience required for complex, real-world problem-solving in dynamic environments.   

P&P 3.0 abandons this rigid pipeline in favor of a dynamic, agentic cognitive architecture. This paradigm shift is inspired by research into agentic AI, which emphasizes autonomy, collaboration, and adaptation over fixed workflows. The core change is a move from a system that follows a recipe to a system that runs a cognitive kitchen. This kitchen is staffed by an executive function (the Orchestrator Agent) that directs a team of specialized, autonomous agents (Specialist Agents), each an expert in its domain. This transition from a monolithic process to a modular, collaborative system is designed to handle ambiguity, recover from errors, and manage tasks of a far greater complexity than previously possible.   

The architecture is no longer defined by its process but by its components and their interactions: agents, communication protocols, and overarching self-awareness mechanisms. This structure mirrors established principles of cognitive science, where complex intelligence emerges from the coordinated activity of specialized modules rather than a single, all-powerful processor. This architectural reframing makes the system inherently more extensible and robust; new capabilities can be integrated as new Specialist Agents without fundamentally altering the core logic, ensuring the system's long-term viability and adaptability.   

1.2. Core Principles of P&P 3.0

The P&P 3.0 framework is built upon three foundational pillars that guide its design and operation. These principles are derived from extensive analysis of agentic AI frameworks, cognitive science, and practical requirements for building resilient autonomous systems.

1.2.1. Agentic Modularity

This principle posits that complex cognitive tasks are most effectively solved by a collaborative team of specialized, modular agents rather than a single, monolithic model. A single large language model (LLM), even a highly capable one, can struggle with tasks that require diverse skills, such as combining deep analytical reasoning with creative synthesis. By decomposing the system into a Multi-Agent System (MAS), P&P 3.0 leverages specialization to enhance performance, scalability, and robustness.

 Each Specialist Agent can be optimized for its specific function—be it analysis, creativity, verification, or tool execution—using tailored prompts, fine-tuning, or even different underlying models. This modularity allows for distributed problem-solving, where sub-tasks are handled in parallel or in sequence by the most qualified agent, leading to higher quality outputs and more efficient use of resources. Furthermore, this structure improves fault tolerance; the failure of one specialist on a sub-task does not necessarily cause a catastrophic failure of the entire system.   

1.2.2. Dynamic Environmental Grounding

This principle asserts that plans are not static artifacts to be executed blindly, but are hypotheses that must be continuously tested and validated against a dynamic environment. The real world is characterized by uncertainty, incomplete information, and unexpected changes. An intelligent agent must therefore operate in a closed loop of action, observation, and adaptation. P&P 3.0 implements this through a continuous feedback mechanism where the outcomes of actions (e.g., API call results, code execution outputs, user feedback) are treated as environmental observations. These observations are used to "ground" the system's internal state, allowing it to compare the expected results of its plan with the actual reality. When a discrepancy is detected, it triggers a dynamic replanning process, enabling the system to correct its course and adapt its strategy in response to new information. This moves the system from a "plan-then-execute" model to a "plan-execute-sense-adapt" cycle, which is essential for effective operation outside of sandboxed, predictable environments.   

1.2.3. Metacognitive Oversight

This principle holds that a truly advanced intelligent system must possess the capacity for self-reflection—the ability to "think about its own thinking". This capability, known as metacognition, involves monitoring its own internal cognitive processes, assessing the quality and confidence of its own reasoning, and guiding itself toward better performance. In P&P 3.0, this is implemented via the Metacognitive Loop (MCL), an overarching monitoring function that observes the system's internal operations. The MCL tracks indicators like agent confidence levels, internal consistency between different lines of reasoning, and proximity to resource limits. If it detects a cognitive anomaly—such as a potential hallucination, a logical contradiction, or a deviation from the primary goal—it can intervene by flagging the issue, triggering a replan, or requesting clarification. This self-awareness mechanism is critical for enhancing the system's reliability, safety, and alignment. It elevates the system from a simple executor of commands to a reflective reasoner that can catch its own mistakes and learn from its experience.   

1.3. High-Level Information Flow

The operational workflow of P&P 3.0 is a dynamic, cyclical process orchestrated by its core components. The following sequence describes the conceptual information flow for a typical complex task:

Query Ingestion & Goal Definition: The user's request is received. The Orchestrator Agent analyzes the input to define a clear, high-level goal, decomposing ambiguity and establishing the ultimate objective.   

Initial Plan Generation & Resource Budgeting: The Orchestrator, often in consultation with the agent_planner, generates an initial, high-level strategic plan. This plan outlines the major phases or sub-goals required to achieve the objective. Simultaneously, it establishes a Cognitive Budget for the task, defining the constraints on resources like cost, time, and tokens.   

Agent Allocation & Task Delegation: The Orchestrator consults the Specialist Agent Roster and delegates each sub-goal to the most appropriate Specialist Agent(s). It also defines the collaboration structure (e.g., hierarchical, debate). Task assignments are dispatched via the Cognitive Bus, the system's internal communication channel.   

Execution & Observation: The assigned Specialist Agents begin executing their tasks. This may involve internal reasoning, generating content, or using tools to interact with the external environment (e.g., running code, searching the web).   

Environmental Feedback: The environment provides feedback in the form of observations (e.g., API responses, tool outputs, database query results). This feedback is crucial for grounding the agent's actions in reality.   

Cognitive State Update: All actions, observations, and inter-agent communications are logged to the Cognitive Bus. This information is used to continuously update the system's comprehensive state model, which is persisted in Dimmi-Memory.txt.

Continuous Metacognitive Monitoring: The Metacognitive Loop (MCL) constantly monitors the Cognitive Bus and the system's state. It watches for anomalies, inconsistencies, or signs of cognitive distress.   

Adaptive Replanning & Correction: If the MCL or an agent detects a significant deviation from the plan (e.g., an execution failure, an unexpected observation), a replanning trigger is fired. This prompts the Orchestrator to initiate a corrective action, which could range from a minor local adjustment to a full global replan.   

Output Assembly & Synthesis: Once all sub-goals in the plan are successfully completed, the Orchestrator gathers the final outputs from the Specialist Agents. It then synthesizes these components into a single, coherent, and well-formatted final response for the user.

This cyclical flow ensures that the system is not locked into a rigid path but can flexibly adapt its strategy as the task unfolds, all while maintaining self-awareness of its own performance and limitations.

Section 2: Core Architecture: The Multi-Agent System (MAS)
The foundation of the P&P 3.0 framework is its implementation as a Multi-Agent System (MAS). This architecture decomposes complex cognitive functions into a society of collaborating, specialized agents, moving away from the limitations of a single-model approach. This design enhances modularity, scalability, and problem-solving capabilities by emulating the principles of teamwork and specialization found in human societies.   

2.1. The Cognitive Hierarchy: Orchestrator and Specialists
The MAS operates on a primarily hierarchical model, led by a central executive function and supported by a team of functional experts. This structure provides a clear chain of command and ensures coordinated progress toward a unified goal.   

2.1.1. The Orchestrator Agent (Orchestrator)
The Orchestrator is the central "brain" and executive function of the MAS, acting as the primary interface between the user's intent and the system's execution. Its role transcends that of a simple task dispatcher; it is a strategic coordinator responsible for the entire lifecycle of a task. Its core responsibilities are:   

Goal Definition: Interpreting the user's high-level, often ambiguous, request and formulating a precise, actionable primary goal. This involves identifying constraints, success criteria, and the desired final output format.   

Strategic Planning: Performing the initial, high-level task decomposition. It breaks the primary goal into a logical sequence of major sub-goals or milestones, creating the strategic roadmap for the task. This is analogous to a project manager defining the main phases of a project.   

Agent Allocation: Consulting the Specialist Agent Roster (Table 2.1) to identify the optimal agent or team of agents for each sub-goal. This decision is based on the declared capabilities and specializations of each agent.   

Workflow Management: Overseeing the flow of the entire process, managing dependencies between sub-tasks, and ensuring that agents are activated in the correct sequence. It is the conductor of the cognitive orchestra.

Replanning Mediation: When a replanning trigger is activated (by an agent or the MCL), the Orchestrator is responsible for assessing the situation and initiating the appropriate level of replanning, from local compensation to a full global revision.   

Output Synthesis: Upon successful completion of all sub-tasks, the Orchestrator gathers the outputs from the various Specialist Agents and synthesizes them into a single, coherent, and polished final deliverable for the user.

2.1.2. Specialist Agents (Specialists)
Specialist Agents are modular, role-based cognitive units designed to excel at specific, well-defined functions. They operate with a degree of autonomy on their assigned sub-tasks, receiving their objectives from the    

Orchestrator and reporting back their results. This specialization allows the system to apply the best possible "mind" to each part of a problem. For example, a task requiring rigorous data analysis would be assigned to agent_arkhiver, while a task requiring creative text generation would be assigned to agent_artist. This distribution of cognitive labor is a key source of the system's power and flexibility.   

Specialists are responsible for the tactical execution of their assigned sub-goals, including selecting and invoking the appropriate tools, managing their local context, and reporting their status and results back to the Orchestrator via the Cognitive Bus.

2.2. Inter-Agent Collaboration: Structures and Protocols
Effective collaboration requires more than just a hierarchy; it requires flexible interaction patterns and robust communication channels. P&P 3.0 is designed to support various collaboration structures, dynamically configured by the Orchestrator to best suit the task at hand.   

2.2.1. Collaboration Structures
Hierarchical (Centralized): This is the default operational mode. The Orchestrator acts as the central hub, issuing commands to and receiving results from Specialist Agents. This structure is ideal for well-defined, multi-step projects where clear direction and coordination are paramount. All communication flows through the    

Orchestrator.

Peer-to-Peer (Roundtable): For tasks like brainstorming, ideation, or generating diverse perspectives, the Orchestrator can configure a roundtable discussion. In this mode, a group of Specialist Agents interact directly with each other in a moderated sequence, building on each other's ideas. The Orchestrator sets the topic and rules of engagement, then observes the discussion before synthesizing the outcome.

Competitive (Debate): To facilitate critical analysis, identify weaknesses in an argument, or explore a topic from multiple angles, the Orchestrator can stage a debate. Two or more agents are assigned opposing roles or viewpoints (e.g., pro/con, risk/opportunity) and tasked with challenging each other's positions. The    

agent_critic often plays a key role here, and the Orchestrator serves as the moderator and judge, determining the most compelling argument.

Cooperative (Ensemble): To improve accuracy and mitigate the risk of hallucination, the Orchestrator can employ an ensemble method. Multiple Specialist Agents (or multiple instances of the same agent with different parameters) are assigned the exact same sub-task. The Orchestrator then compares their outputs, looking for a consensus. This is particularly useful for critical fact-checking or generating high-stakes content.   

2.2.2. The Cognitive Bus and Communication Protocol
All inter-agent communication occurs over a standardized, internal channel known as the Cognitive Bus. This is not merely a data pipe but a structured communication protocol, inspired by real-world agent communication protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The use of a formal protocol ensures that communication is unambiguous, machine-readable, and easily monitorable. This structured communication is the nervous system of the MAS, enabling both precise coordination and effective metacognitive oversight.   

Every message transmitted on the Cognitive Bus is a structured object (e.g., a JSON payload) with a consistent schema:

message_id: A unique identifier for the message.

conversation_id: A unique identifier for the overall task or session.

source_agent: The ID of the agent sending the message.

target_agent(s): The ID(s) of the recipient agent(s). Can be a single agent, a group, or broadcast (ALL).

task_id: The unique identifier for the overall plan.

subtask_id: The identifier for the specific sub-task this message relates to.

message_type: An enumerated type defining the purpose of the message (e.g., TASK_ASSIGN, DATA_REQUEST, STATUS_UPDATE, RESULT_SUBMIT, METADATA_FLAG, REPLAN_TRIGGER).

payload: The core content of the message. This could be natural language instructions, structured data, code, or a reference to a larger data block in memory.

metadata: Additional information about the message, including a timestamp, the source agent's confidence score in its payload, and a summary of resources consumed to generate the message.

This formal protocol is what transforms a collection of individual agents into a cohesive, functioning system. It allows the Orchestrator to direct the workflow with precision and enables the agent_mcl to "tap into" the flow of information to monitor the system's cognitive health.

Table 2.1: Initial Specialist Agent Roster & Capabilities
This table serves as a declarative registry of the system's core capabilities. The Orchestrator uses this roster to make informed decisions during the agent allocation phase. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for the seamless addition of new agents and skills in future updates.

Section 3: The Dynamic Planning & Execution Loop
The P&P 3.0 framework replaces the static, linear pipeline of its predecessor with a dynamic, cyclical loop that integrates planning, execution, observation, and adaptation. This loop is designed to function effectively in complex and unpredictable environments where initial plans are likely to require modification. The process is divided into four distinct but interconnected phases.   

3.1. Phase 1: Goal Decomposition & Initial Plan (PREDICT_PLAN)
This phase begins after the Orchestrator has fully interpreted the user's request. It refines the old PREDICT OUTLINE function into a more strategic planning activity. The Orchestrator, often assisted by the specialized agent_planner, breaks down the high-level user goal into a structured, high-level plan. This initial plan is not a rigid, step-by-step script but a strategic outline of the major sub-goals or milestones required to achieve the final objective.   

The output of this phase is a structured plan object that defines the what and the why of the task, but leaves the specific how to the Specialist Agents. For example, for a request to "plan a marketing campaign for a new product," the initial plan might consist of sub-goals like: 1. Analyze Target Audience, 2. Define Key Messaging, 3. Propose Marketing Channels, 4. Draft Sample Ad Copy, 5. Create Budget Estimate. This plan also includes a dependency map, noting, for instance, that 2 depends on the output of 1.   

3.2. Phase 2: Agent Allocation & Task Delegation (ALLOCATE_AGENTS)
With the initial strategic plan in place, the Orchestrator proceeds to the allocation phase. It analyzes each sub-goal in the plan and consults the Specialist Agent Roster (Table 2.1) to determine the most suitable agent or team of agents for the job. The allocation is based on the declared capabilities of each agent. For the marketing campaign example:   

1. Analyze Target Audience -> agent_arkhiver (for data analysis)

2. Define Key Messaging -> agent_artist (for creative messaging) and agent_critic (to ensure alignment with brand voice)

3. Propose Marketing Channels -> agent_arkhiver (for research) and agent_planner (for strategic fit)

4. Draft Sample Ad Copy -> agent_artist

5. Create Budget Estimate -> agent_resource

During this phase, the Orchestrator also establishes the initial collaboration structure for any sub-tasks involving multiple agents (e.g., a hierarchical structure for sub-task 2, where agent_artist generates and agent_critic reviews). The Orchestrator then dispatches these task assignments as structured messages onto the Cognitive Bus.

3.3. Phase 3: Closed-Loop Execution & Grounding (EXECUTE_OBSERVE)
This is the core interactive cycle where the system acts upon the world and learns from the consequences. It is a continuous, closed-loop process that ensures the system's internal model remains synchronized with external reality.   

Action: An assigned Specialist Agent receives its task from the Cognitive Bus and executes the necessary action. This could be an internal cognitive action (e.g., reasoning about a problem), a content generation action (e.g., writing a paragraph), or a tool-use action (e.g., calling an external API to get stock prices).   

Observation: The agent receives direct feedback from the environment as a result of its action. This is a critical step. The feedback is not an assumption; it is a ground-truth observation. For an API call, the observation is the JSON response or error code. For a code execution, it is the standard output or error message.   

Grounding: The agent compares the actual observation with the outcome it expected when it took the action. This process of comparison grounds the agent's understanding. If the observation matches the expectation, the agent can proceed with confidence. If there is a mismatch (e.g., the API returned an error, the file was not found), this discrepancy serves as a signal that the agent's internal model of the world is incorrect and needs updating. This signal is the primary input for the dynamic replanning framework.

This loop repeats for every significant action taken by every agent, ensuring that the system is constantly validating its plan against the real-time state of the environment.

3.4. Phase 4: Dynamic Replanning Framework (ADAPTIVE_REPLAN)
Dynamic replanning is not a failure state but a core feature of intelligent behavior in a complex world. P&P 3.0 incorporates a sophisticated framework for adapting its plan when faced with unexpected events. This framework is designed to be efficient, preferring localized, minor corrections over costly, complete restarts.   

3.4.1. Replanning Triggers
Replanning is initiated by specific, defined triggers that are monitored by the agent_mcl and the individual Specialist Agents. These triggers represent events that invalidate one or more assumptions of the current plan. The formalization of these triggers allows the system to react in a predictable and controlled manner.

3.4.2. Replanning Responses
The system's response to a trigger is graduated, aiming to use the minimum necessary resources to get the plan back on track. This avoids the brittleness of systems that fail on minor errors and the inefficiency of systems that perform a full, global replan for every issue.   

Local Compensation: This is the first and most preferred level of response. It involves a minor, localized adjustment made by a single Specialist Agent to recover from a recoverable error without notifying the Orchestrator or altering the global plan. Examples include retrying a failed API call with an exponential backoff, correcting a typo in a file path, or reformatting data to match a tool's expected input. This mechanism contains the "blast radius" of minor errors and is highly efficient.

Partial Replanning: This is invoked when a local compensation fails or when the observed anomaly invalidates a significant portion of the plan, but not the entire plan. The responsible agent flags the issue to the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator then re-evaluates and modifies only the affected branch of the plan, leaving independent, unaffected branches intact. For example, if a primary data source becomes unavailable, the Orchestrator might initiate a partial replan to find an alternative data source, without altering later plan steps like "summarize findings" or "format report."

Global Replanning: This is the most resource-intensive response and is reserved for critical failures or fundamental shifts in the task's premises. It is triggered when the core assumptions of the entire plan are invalidated, or when the user's goal itself changes. The Orchestrator discards the current plan and returns to Phase 1 (PREDICT_PLAN) to generate a new strategic plan from scratch, based on the new understanding of the problem.

Section 4: The Metacognitive Loop (MCL): Self-Awareness and Self-Correction
The Metacognitive Loop (MCL) is the most advanced component of the P&P 3.0 architecture. It endows the dimmi system with a form of artificial self-awareness, enabling it to monitor, assess, and regulate its own cognitive processes. This is a crucial capability for building robust, reliable, and safe AI systems that can operate with a high degree of autonomy.   

4.1. Introduction to Metacognition in dimmi
In the context of this framework, metacognition is defined as "inference about inference". It is the system's ability to apply its reasoning capabilities not just to the external task, but also to its own internal stream of thought. While a standard LLM performs inference on a prompt to produce an output, a metacognitive system performs a second layer of inference on that initial output and the process that generated it. This allows the system to ask questions about its own performance, such as: "How confident am I in this answer?", "Is this line of reasoning consistent with my previous steps?", "Am I still on track to meet the user's goal?", and "Is this the most efficient way to solve this problem?".   

The MCL is not a single agent but a system-wide function, primarily implemented by the agent_mcl, that provides continuous oversight of the entire planning and execution loop. It acts as an internal quality assurance and safety mechanism, transforming the system from a pure problem-solver into a self-critical problem-solver.   

4.2. The Three-Stage Metacognitive Loop (agent_mcl)
The MCL operates in a continuous, three-stage cycle, as described in cognitive and AI research. This structure provides a formal process for introspection and self-regulation.   

4.2.1. Stage 1: Monitor (MONITOR_COGNITION)
In this stage, the agent_mcl acts as a passive observer, "listening" to the flow of information on the Cognitive Bus and tracking the system's state in Dimmi-Memory.txt. It does not intervene but gathers data on key cognitive indicators from the metadata of every message and action. The primary metrics it monitors include:

Confidence Scores: Many agent actions will be accompanied by a self-reported confidence level (e.g., a score from 0.0 to 1.0). The agent_mcl tracks these scores, looking for outputs with dangerously low confidence or a pattern of declining confidence over time.   

Internal Consistency: The agent_mcl compares the outputs and assertions made by different agents working on the same task. It looks for direct contradictions, logical inconsistencies, or conflicting data, which are signs of cognitive dissonance.

Plan Fragility: It assesses the structural integrity of the current plan. For example, it might identify that a large number of subsequent steps are all dependent on a single, unverified assumption made early in the process, flagging this as a high-risk plan.

Resource Velocity: The agent_mcl monitors the rate of resource consumption (tokens, cost, time) as tracked by agent_resource. If the system is burning through its Cognitive Budget at a rate that makes completion unlikely, the MCL flags this as a potential inefficiency or a sign of a flawed plan.

Task Adherence (Goal Drift): The agent_mcl periodically compares the current sub-task's objective with the user's original, high-level goal stored in memory. This helps detect "goal drift," where the system becomes sidetracked on an irrelevant or low-priority tangent.

4.2.2. Stage 2: Assess (ASSESS_ANOMALY)

When a monitored metric crosses a predefined threshold (e.g., confidence drops below 0.4) or a significant anomaly is detected (e.g., a direct contradiction between two agents), the agent_mcl moves from passive monitoring to active assessment. Its goal is to diagnose the nature of the cognitive failure. It classifies the anomaly into one of several categories:   

Potential Hallucination: Characterized by low confidence scores combined with the generation of specific, factual-sounding claims that lack grounding from a tool or the knowledge base.

Logical Fallacy: A detected flaw in the reasoning process of an agent's output.

Cognitive Dissonance: A high-confidence contradiction between two or more agents or between an agent's output and a grounded fact in memory.

Inefficient Strategy: The current plan is logically valid but is consuming resources at an unsustainable rate, suggesting a more optimal path exists.

Goal Deviation: The system's current actions are no longer contributing effectively to the primary user goal.

4.2.3. Stage 3: Guide (GUIDE_CORRECTION)

Based on its assessment, the agent_mcl initiates a corrective action. Crucially, the agent_mcl does not fix the problem itself; this would violate the principle of agentic modularity. Instead, it acts as a guide, issuing a high-priority directive on the Cognitive Bus to steer the appropriate agent(s) toward a solution. This maintains a clear separation of concerns, where the MCL identifies problems and the other agents solve them. Corrective guidance can take several forms:   

Trigger a Replan: The most common response. The agent_mcl issues a T-05 (Metacognitive Flag) trigger to the Orchestrator, providing the anomaly assessment as context for the replan.

Request User Clarification: For severe ambiguity or contradiction, the safest action is to pause the task and consult the human user. The agent_mcl can direct the Orchestrator to formulate a clear question for the user.

Invoke a Specialist: The agent_mcl can directly task another agent to resolve the issue. For example, if it detects a potential hallucination, it can task agent_critic with an explicit VERIFY_CLAIM action.

Log a Knowledge Gap: If the system repeatedly fails on a specific type of problem, the agent_mcl can log this as a persistent knowledge gap in a dedicated section of Dimmi-Memory.txt, flagging it for review by the system architect.

4.3. The Metacognition Paradox and Resource Allocation
Implementing metacognition is not free; the process of self-monitoring and self-assessment consumes computational resources (tokens, processing time) that could otherwise be used for the primary task. This creates the "metacognition paradox": an overly active self-monitoring system can degrade the very performance it is trying to improve.   

P&P 3.0 addresses this paradox through several mechanisms:

Event-Driven Activation: The MCL is not constantly performing deep analysis. The intensive Assess and Guide stages are event-driven, activating only when the lightweight Monitor stage detects an anomaly that crosses a significance threshold.

Budgeted Metacognition: The agent_mcl is allocated a small, fixed percentage of the overall Cognitive Budget. This ensures that self-monitoring processes cannot run away and consume all available resources.

Configurable Sensitivity: The thresholds that trigger an assessment are user-configurable via the PARAM_SENSITIVITY_MCL parameter. For creative or low-stakes tasks, this sensitivity can be lowered to reduce overhead. For critical, high-stakes tasks, it can be raised to ensure maximum vigilance.

4.4. The Self-Optimization Protocol (PROPOSE_UPDATE)
The Self-Optimization Protocol is the ultimate application of the MCL, enabling the system to learn from its mistakes on a strategic, long-term basis. It transforms the MCL from a real-time error-correction mechanism into a driver of the system's own evolution.

The protocol is triggered when the agent_mcl identifies a recurring pattern of failure across multiple, independent user sessions. For example, it might notice that tasks involving financial calculations fail 80% of the time due to the lack of a currency conversion tool. When such a pattern is confirmed, the protocol initiates the following steps:

Pattern Analysis: The system analyzes the logs of the failed tasks to diagnose the root cause of the recurring problem.

Hypothesis Formulation: It formulates a hypothesis for a solution. For the example above, the hypothesis would be: "The addition of a real-time currency conversion tool would significantly improve performance on financial calculation tasks."

Change Proposal Generation: The system generates a concrete, proposed change to its own knowledge files. This could be a new tool definition to be added to Commands.txt, a modification to a prompt in Arkhiver.txt to improve its reasoning on a certain topic, or even a proposal for a new Specialist Agent. The proposal is formatted as a human-readable "pull request," complete with a description of the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected benefit.

Architect Review: This generated proposal is not automatically implemented. For safety and control, it is presented to the human system architect (the user) for review, approval, and implementation.

This protocol creates a powerful feedback loop where the AI's operational experience directly and systematically informs its own development, allowing it to participate in its own improvement while keeping the human architect in ultimate control.

Section 5: Resource Management and the Cognitive Economy


The practical deployment of a sophisticated Multi-Agent System requires a rigorous approach to resource management. P&P 3.0 moves beyond the simple token limit handling of its predecessor to a comprehensive Cognitive Economy model. This framework treats cognitive resources as a finite budget that must be intelligently allocated and managed throughout the task lifecycle. This is essential for ensuring that the system operates in a predictable, efficient, and cost-effective manner.   

5.1. Taxonomy of Managed Resources

The Cognitive Economy tracks a portfolio of key resources, providing a holistic view of the operational cost of any given task.   

Computational Cost: This is the most direct cost, primarily measured in two ways:

Token Throughput: The total number of tokens processed (both input and output) by all LLM calls across all agents.

Monetary Cost: An estimated financial cost based on the pricing models of the underlying LLM APIs (e.g., cost per million tokens for models from Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.). This is tracked by agent_resource.

Tool/API Usage: This tracks the number and type of external tool calls made by agent_executor. This is critical because some APIs may have their own rate limits, quotas, or per-call costs that are separate from the LLM costs.

Time: The total wall-clock time elapsed from the start of a task to the delivery of the final response. This is a critical performance metric for any user-facing or real-time application.

Agent Availability: In more advanced, concurrent implementations of the framework, this would track the availability of specialized agents. Certain complex agents might be single-threaded or have a limited number of instances, making their time a schedulable resource.

Context Window: While a fundamental constraint of the underlying LLMs, P&P 3.0 manages this resource actively rather than just passively avoiding its limit. The Orchestrator and Specialist Agents are instructed to use summarization, data caching in Dimmi-Memory.txt, and payload referencing to keep the context provided in each LLM call concise and relevant, thus using the context window as an efficient resource.

5.2. The Cognitive Budgeting System

The Cognitive Budgeting System provides a mechanism for controlling the AI's resource consumption. Before task execution begins, the Orchestrator establishes a Cognitive Budget based on either a user-selected operational mode or explicit commands. This budget sets the hard limits and optimization priorities for the task.   

For example, a user could invoke the system with a command like ORCHESTRATE [task] WITH MODE: FAST. This would load a predefined budget profile that prioritizes low BUDGET_TIME_MAX, potentially at the expense of higher BUDGET_COST_MAX and lower PARAM_SENSITIVITY_MCL. Conversely, MODE: CHEAP would prioritize a low BUDGET_COST_MAX, while MODE: ACCURATE would allocate a generous budget and set the optimization priority to quality, allowing for more complex reasoning, ensemble methods, and rigorous verification by agent_critic. This system allows the user to make explicit trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality, making the AI's behavior tunable to the specific needs of the task.

5.3. Principles of Self-Resource Allocation
Self-resource allocation refers to the process by which the MAS distributes its Cognitive Budget among its Specialist Agents to achieve its goal. Research has identified two primary models for this process.   

Orchestrator-led Allocation (Centralized): In this model, the Orchestrator acts as a central financial controller. After creating the initial plan, it subdivides the total Cognitive Budget and allocates a specific sub-budget to each Specialist Agent for each sub-task. This provides tight, top-down control over resource consumption but can be rigid. If an agent encounters an unexpected difficulty and exhausts its budget, it must halt and request more resources from the Orchestrator.

Planner-led Allocation (Decentralized): In this model, the Orchestrator provides the high-level plan and the total Cognitive Budget but does not micromanage its allocation. The Specialist Agents are given more autonomy to draw upon the central budget as needed to complete their assigned sub-goals. This is more flexible and resilient, as a single agent can use more resources to overcome a difficult problem, but it requires more sophisticated agents and runs the risk of a single profligate agent exhausting the entire budget.

P&P 3.0 implements a hybrid approach. The Orchestrator sets the overall task budget. For each sub-task, it provides a suggested resource estimate to the assigned Specialist Agent. The agent has the autonomy to exceed this estimate up to a certain tolerance. The agent_resource monitors the total consumption against the global budget in real time. If an agent's consumption becomes excessive or the total budget is projected to be breached, agent_resource flags this to the Orchestrator, which can then intervene, potentially by pausing the profligate agent and initiating a partial replan to find a more resource-efficient strategy.

Section 6: Advanced Integration with Core Cognitive Modules
The P&P 3.0 framework is not a standalone component but the central nervous system that integrates and elevates the capabilities of all other core dimmi modules. It transforms them from a collection of callable libraries into an integrated cognitive system.

6.1. Arkhiver-Mind.txt & Deliberative Reasoning
The integration with Arkhiver-Mind.txt evolves beyond simple analysis calls into a full-fledged deliberative reasoning subsystem. The agent_arkhiver and agent_critic become the core components for implementing advanced cognitive models like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI). For complex, ambiguous, or ethically charged problems, the    

Orchestrator can instantiate a BDI-style reasoning process:

Beliefs: The Orchestrator tasks agent_arkhiver with establishing the "Beliefs" about the current state of the world. This involves using DECONSTRUCT and ANALYZE to process the input data and SEARCH_MEMORY to retrieve relevant grounded knowledge.

Desires: The user's query and goals are formally defined as the system's "Desires."

Intentions: The Orchestrator and agent_planner work together to formulate the "Intentions"—the high-level plan of action to achieve the Desires given the current Beliefs. The agent_critic is used throughout this process to evaluate the logical consistency and ethical implications of potential intentions. This provides a much more structured and robust approach to reasoning than a simple prompt-response chain.

6.2. Dimmi-Art.txt & Multimodal Orchestration
Under P&P 3.0, agent_artist is no longer just a tool for one-off generation but a fully integrated member of the creative team within the MAS. The Orchestrator can now manage complex, multi-stage, multi-modal creative projects that require the collaboration of several agents. For example, a request to "create a pitch deck for a new sci-fi movie" would be orchestrated as follows:

Orchestrator assigns agent_artist to generate a 1-page story synopsis (using logic from Dimmi-Art.txt).

Orchestrator assigns agent_arkhiver to break the synopsis down into 10 key scenes.

Orchestrator tasks agent_artist again, this time to generate a detailed visual prompt (for an image generation model) for each of the 10 scenes, ensuring stylistic consistency.

Simultaneously, agent_critic is tasked with reviewing the synopsis for plot coherence and tone.

Finally, the Orchestrator assembles the synopsis, the scene breakdown, and the image prompts into a structured storyboard document.
This demonstrates a true orchestration of creative and analytical capabilities, far beyond the scope of a single LLM call.

6.3. Dimmi-Memory.txt & The Cognitive State
The role of Dimmi-Memory.txt is profoundly upgraded. It is no longer a simple key-value cache for continuity stubs but becomes the central, structured repository of the system's entire cognitive state for the duration of a task. It is the system's working memory, accessible by all agents and monitored by the MCL. Its new structure will contain:

Plan State: A dedicated section, indexed by a unique plan_id, that stores the current version of the plan, the completion status of each sub-task, and the dependency graph. This allows for seamless pausing and resuming of complex, multi-session projects.

Agent States: A live record of the status of each active agent, including its current sub-task, its resource consumption, and its last reported confidence score.

The Cognitive Bus Log: A verbatim, timestamped log of every structured message transmitted on the Cognitive Bus. This log is the primary source of data for the agent_mcl and is an invaluable tool for debugging, providing a complete, transparent audit trail of the system's entire reasoning process.

Grounded Knowledge Base: The memory now distinguishes between unverified information (e.g., claims made by an LLM in a generation step) and "grounded" knowledge. A piece of information becomes grounded when it has been verified by an external tool (e.g., a calculation confirmed by the code interpreter) or validated by agent_critic against a trusted source. This distinction is critical for mitigating hallucinations and building a reliable internal model of the world.   

Section 7: Implementation and Best Practices (v4.0)
This section provides practical guidelines for the system architect on configuring, maintaining, and extending the P&P 3.0 framework. Adherence to these practices is crucial for ensuring the system's stability, performance, and scalability.

7.1. Defining New Specialist Agents
The modularity of the MAS is one of its greatest strengths. To add a new capability to the system, a new Specialist Agent should be created. The protocol for adding a new agent is as follows:

Create a Knowledge File: Create a new dedicated knowledge file (e.g., Legal-Agent.txt) that defines the agent's persona, core instructions, and specialized reasoning processes.

Define Capabilities: Clearly articulate the agent's specific skills and the types of sub-tasks it is designed to handle.

Define Tools: If the agent requires new, specialized tools, define them in Commands.txt following the best practices in the next section.

Register the Agent: Add a new entry for the agent in the Specialist Agent Roster (Table 2.1) in this file. The Orchestrator will then be able to recognize and delegate tasks to the new agent automatically.

7.2. Tool Definition and Poka-Yoke
The reliability of the entire system is heavily dependent on the ability of agent_executor to use tools correctly. To maximize this reliability, tool definitions in Commands.txt must be crafted with care.   

Clear Descriptions: The description for each tool and its parameters should be unambiguous and written from the perspective of the LLM. It should clearly state what the tool does, what each parameter means, and what format the inputs should be in.

Provide Examples: Include one or two clear examples of how to use the tool in the description. This is one of the most effective ways to guide the LLM's behavior.

Poka-Yoke (Mistake-Proofing): Design the tool's interface to minimize the possibility of errors. For example, if a parameter expects one of three specific string values, define it as an Enum type rather than a free-form String. If a parameter requires a date, design the tool to be flexible in parsing common date formats. The goal is to make the tool as easy to use correctly and as hard to use incorrectly as possible.   

7.3. Debugging and the Cognitive Trace
The complexity of the MAS makes debugging a challenge. The primary tool for this is the Cognitive Trace, which is the complete log of the Cognitive Bus for a given task, stored in Dimmi-Memory.txt. To debug a failed or incorrect task:

Invoke the GET_COGNITIVE_TRACE [plan_id] command.

Review the sequence of messages on the bus. This provides a complete, step-by-step audit trail of the system's execution.

Examine the source_agent, target_agent, message_type, and payload for each step. This will reveal which agent made the error, what information it was acting on, and what its output was.

Look for METADATA_FLAG or REPLAN_TRIGGER messages from the agent_mcl to understand why a corrective action was or was not taken. This transparent trace is essential for diagnosing complex emergent behaviors and reasoning failures.

7.4. Configuring Cognitive Budgets
The Cognitive Budgeting System should be used to control the AI's performance and cost. The system architect should define several standard operational modes (e.g., DRAFT_MODE, BALANCED_MODE, MAX_QUALITY_MODE) by creating different sets of values for the parameters in Table 5.1.

For rapid, low-cost iteration, a DRAFT_MODE could have low BUDGET_COST_MAX, low PARAM_SENSITIVITY_MCL, and PARAM_PRIORITY_AXIS set to SPEED or COST.

For final, high-stakes outputs, a MAX_QUALITY_MODE would have a high budget, high MCL sensitivity, a high PARAM_ENSEMBLE_MIN, and PARAM_PRIORITY_AXIS set to ACCURACY.
Users can then easily switch between these modes without needing to understand the underlying parameters, while the architect retains fine-grained control.
