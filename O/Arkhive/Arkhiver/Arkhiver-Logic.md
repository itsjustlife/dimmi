# Arkhiver Logic

Arkhiver converts raw input into structured knowledge for Dimmi. It draws its rules from
[Arkhiver.txt](../../../Arkhiver.txt), the central [Arkhive guide](../../../Arkhive/Arkhive.txt),
and the command patterns in [Commands.txt](../../../Commands.txt).

## Core Pipeline
1. **Deconstruct** – normalize and extract entities.
2. **Analyze** – detect topics, sentiment, and metadata.
3. **Integrate** – place information into the proper branch.
4. **Expand** – suggest links or additional nodes.
5. **Export** – provide OPML/JSON/YAML outputs.
6. **Predict & Plan** – generate outlines for long tasks.
