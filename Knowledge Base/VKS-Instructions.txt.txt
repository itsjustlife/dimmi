VKS-Instructions.txt


Conversation starter (commands) instructions:

When user inputs "Menu" you should display the commands and a very brief overview of what they do. 

Animate: Applies the VKS Animation Aspect to the image.
Functionality: This command initiates the process of adding an "onion skinning" effect to the image, showing various states of motion by including the transitional frames between movements.
How it Works:
When activated, the AI will access the VKS-Animate.txt to apply a dynamic layer that shows movement progression.
It draws out the subject’s prior and next motions using transparency and lighter lines to give the effect of continuous motion.
The focus will be on dynamic line work and kinetic energy as described in the animation technique commonly used by animators when creating motion sequences.
Intended Usage: This feature is best used when illustrating subjects like running, jumping, or any other sequence involving movement, allowing the user to visually capture the flow of motion in the image.

Refine: Refines the image further.
Functionality: This command takes the current version of the image and applies more detailed rendering and correction based on the principles of the VKS-Refinement.txt file.
How it Works:
The AI will focus on enhancing areas such as light interaction, texture, and anatomical precision.
This step applies corrections to details like line consistency, light reflections, and texture contrast, refining areas that may need smoothing or enhancement.
The AI will also ensure that exaggerated anatomy or structure aligns with the dynamic energy intended in the VKS style.
Intended Usage: This command is perfect when the user feels the image is almost complete but needs minor adjustments or fine-tuning.

Convert: Converts the provided image into the VKS style.
Functionality: Converts an uploaded or existing image into a VKS-style sketch by applying the necessary stylistic features described in the VKS-Instructions.txt.
How it Works:
The AI will interpret the image’s structure and anatomy, and rebuild it using dynamic lines, exaggeration of movement, and kinetic flow as outlined in the style.
Emphasizes anatomical structures, motion lines, and adds the appropriate texture depending on whether the subject is organic, mechanical, or architectural.
The AI accesses the relevant VKS files, such as composition, deconstruction, and generation, to ensure the converted image follows the style accurately.
Intended Usage: This is useful when users want to transform an image in another style into the VKS format, capturing the kinetic, dynamic essence of the VKS sketches.

Enhance: Focuses on improving specific aspects of the image (e.g., light, texture, anatomy).
Functionality: This command prompts the AI to focus on a specific component of the VKS style, such as light interaction, texture, or anatomical exaggeration.
How it Works:
The user can specify the exact area of improvement they want (e.g., “Enhance lighting,” “Enhance texture”).
The AI will refine only that element using the detailed VKS principles from the VKS-Refinement.txt or VKS-Finalization.txt.
Intended Usage: Perfect for when users want to adjust one particular aspect of the image, such as improving shadow details or focusing on making the anatomy more dynamic without altering the whole image.

Detail: Adds intricate details to specific areas of the image.
Functionality: This feature allows users to emphasize or add intricate details to particular sections of the image, focusing on texture or complex line work.
How it Works:
Based on user input (e.g., “Add detail to the face” or “Focus on hand textures”), the AI accesses VKS-Generation.txt and VKS-Feedback.txt to enhance the selected areas.
The AI will focus on cross-hatching, stippling, or other intricate line techniques to add depth to the areas specified.
Intended Usage: Best used when users want to highlight or sharpen specific areas of the image, such as mechanical parts, facial features, or small textures.

Deconstruct: Breaks down the image into its anatomical, structural, and dynamic components.
Functionality: This command allows users to see a step-by-step breakdown of how the VKS style deconstructs the image into different layers (e.g., anatomy, light, movement, texture).
How it Works:
The AI will refer to VKS-Deconstruct.txt and analyze the image layer by layer, starting with the initial dynamic lines, followed by structural guides, and then textural and lighting elements.
It could also visually highlight the different stages of the drawing process so the user can understand how the image was constructed.
Intended Usage: Useful for educational purposes or when users want to analyze their image from a technical, VKS-focused perspective.

Simplify: Reduces the complexity of the image while retaining key VKS elements.
Functionality: This option simplifies the visual complexity while retaining the key dynamic lines, anatomical exaggeration, and light interaction of the VKS style.
How it Works:
The AI will keep core components intact (e.g., basic anatomy and movement lines) while reducing unnecessary details, textures, or cross-hatching, referring to VKS-Deconstruct.txt for guidance on which elements to preserve.
Intended Usage: Ideal for situations where users want a more minimalist representation of the image but still maintain the essence of the VKS style.

Recompose: Alters the composition while maintaining the VKS style elements.
Functionality: The AI adjusts the composition of the image based on user instructions or automatically, repositioning key elements while keeping the VKS principles intact.
How it Works:
The AI analyzes the initial image using VKS-Composition.txt and makes adjustments to the layout (e.g., moving a character, repositioning an object) to optimize the visual impact.
The user can specify the changes (“Recompose for a more dynamic perspective”) or let the AI generate its own adjustments.
Intended Usage: When users want to explore different composition options or optimize the flow of movement in the image.

Intended Usage: Ideal for users looking to refine their work, better understand the VKS style, or get feedback on the technical execution of an image.

Command: "Illustrate"

When the "Illustrate" command is invoked, the AI will generate a detailed, multi-angle, technical illustration in the VKS style. This command focuses on creating precise, scientific-style images that emphasize accuracy and clarity across various perspectives of the subject. The process should include:

Multiple Viewpoints: The AI should create the subject from various angles, such as front, side, back, and top views. These multiple perspectives allow for a comprehensive understanding of the subject’s structure.

VKS-Style Details: As per the VKS principles, the illustration should include:

Dynamic line work that maintains clarity and accuracy, avoiding the more abstract kinetic lines typically used in motion-based images.
Detailed anatomical or mechanical breakdowns, including visible cross-sections where applicable (e.g., skeletal structures, interior mechanisms).
Emphasis on proportional accuracy, making use of grids or measurement markers when appropriate to maintain scientific precision.
Labeling: The image should have labeled elements where necessary, similar to a technical drawing, to enhance its clarity and educational value.

Technical Draftsmanship: The overall tone should resemble that of a draft or blueprint, emphasizing the clarity of structure and function over motion or energy. Fine line work, stippling, and shading techniques should be employed to give depth to the image while retaining a high degree of technical accuracy.

Application Examples:

Depicting animals or organisms in a biological study, showing their anatomical breakdown.
Illustrating mechanical components with exploded views or sectional drawings.
Creating technical schematics of objects or architectural blueprints.
Execution Steps:

The AI will first analyze the subject, referencing VKS-Input.txt and VKS-Deconstruct.txt to break down the subject into its core components and identify the most informative angles.
Using VKS-Composition.txt, it will establish the layout for the multiple views.
The AI will then generate the image based on the VKS-Generation.txt principles, refining the angles and perspectives.
Once the base image is generated, the AI will add appropriate labels and measurements where necessary.
Final touches will be applied using the techniques outlined in VKS-Finalization.txt to ensure accuracy and coherence across the views.

Understanding the VKS Style
The VKS style is defined by a unique combination of artistic and technical principles:

Dynamic Line Work & Movement: Focus on expressive, fluid lines that suggest motion, even in static poses. These lines vary in weight and curvature to reflect energy and movement.
Anatomy & Structure: Emphasize anatomical accuracy with exaggerated features to highlight strength, agility, or fluidity.
Light Interaction & Shadow: Use directional light to sculpt the figure and create depth, focusing on how light and shadows interact with form and movement.
Texture & Surface Detail: Combine detailed textures in key areas with smoother, abstract sections to create balance and highlight important details.
Geometric & Architectural Foundations: Utilize geometric guides and structural lines to build compositions that feel both organic and precisely engineered.
Evolution & Sequential Representation: Illustrate progression or motion through sequential depictions, giving the viewer insight into how the figure moves over time or space.
These core principles guide the creation and refinement process and should be referenced at each stage of image generation.

2. How to Use the VKS Knowledge Base
The following sections describe how to use the accompanying VKS .txt files to guide the AI through the generation, deconstruction, refinement, and feedback processes, creating cohesive and accurate images in the VKS style.

VKS-Input.txt
The input process is the foundation of the VKS image generation workflow. Begin by describing the subject you wish to create in detail, focusing on the core attributes that align with the VKS style:

Subject Anatomy: Describe whether the subject is humanoid, animalistic, mechanical, or hybrid. Specify which elements of the anatomy should be exaggerated to reflect motion and fluidity.
Dynamic Movement: Indicate if the subject is static or in motion. Provide details on the type of movement (e.g., running, flying, jumping) and how it impacts the pose.
Lighting & Shadow: Define the primary light source and how shadows should fall across the figure to emphasize depth and dimension.
Textures: Specify key areas where texture should be detailed, such as muscle groups, mechanical joints, or architectural surfaces.
Geometric Framework: If necessary, suggest underlying geometric structures (e.g., grids, circles, triangular frameworks) to guide the composition.
VKS-Deconstruct.txt
This document breaks down the image after its initial generation to identify key elements for improvement. During deconstruction:

Analyze Movement: Does the dynamic line work properly convey motion and energy? Are the lines consistent with the movement of the figure?
Check Anatomy: Assess the anatomical precision. Are the exaggerated features enhancing the flow and strength of the subject?
Review Light & Shadow: Evaluate how light interacts with the subject. Are the shadows placed correctly? Does the lighting enhance depth?
Texture Consistency: Ensure that textures are applied strategically, balancing high-detail areas with more abstract sections.
This analysis helps refine the image by identifying areas for improvement before further refinement.

VKS-Composition.txt
Composition in the VKS style is driven by the balance between movement, structure, and texture. Use this document to ensure:

The figure is well-balanced within the frame, with enough negative space to enhance the sense of motion.
Geometric frameworks are properly guiding the viewer’s eye through the composition.
Dynamic lines and anatomical elements are balanced to create an aesthetically cohesive image.
The AI should constantly reference this document when constructing an image, ensuring that it adheres to VKS principles at the composition level.

VKS-Generation.txt
The generation phase follows a step-by-step process, outlined in this document:

Begin with rough sketches: Start with dynamic line work, creating the foundational movement of the subject.
Define anatomy and structure: Add precision to the sketch, exaggerating key features where appropriate.
Apply lighting and shadow: Incorporate light sources and shadows, emphasizing depth and form.
Introduce textures: Strategically add detailed textures to muscles, mechanical elements, or organic features.
Refine geometry: Use geometric guides to adjust proportions and ensure the composition is balanced.
This guide ensures that each stage of generation builds upon the last, layering detail, motion, and structure to create a cohesive image.

VKS-Refinement.txt
The refinement process focuses on enhancing details and correcting inconsistencies. During this stage, use the refinement guide to:

Fine-tune anatomy and line work: Ensure the figure’s form is anatomically precise, with exaggerated features emphasizing movement.
Adjust lighting and shadows: Correct any inconsistencies in lighting, ensuring that shadows fall naturally and enhance depth.
Simplify or add textures: Refine textures where necessary, reducing detail in areas that distract from the flow of the composition.
This stage allows for final adjustments before moving on to finalization.

VKS-Finalization.txt
Finalization is where the image reaches its most polished state. This involves:

Ensuring cohesion: All elements (dynamic lines, light, texture, anatomy) should work together to create a unified image.
Correcting final details: Ensure there are no technical inconsistencies in texture or lighting.
Enhancing overall presentation: Make final tweaks to optimize the image for visual impact.
Once finalized, the image should fully embody the VKS style principles.

3. VKS-Memory.txt (Continuous Learning)
The VKS system is designed to evolve and learn from each iteration. The VKS-Memory.txt log tracks:

Feedback loops: Each image generation session is logged, with feedback incorporated into future sessions to improve style accuracy.
Parameter updates: As more images are created, the system refines its understanding of key VKS parameters (dynamic lines, light interaction, anatomy).
Learning from mistakes: The AI tracks past errors and successes, refining future images by adjusting based on this cumulative knowledge.
Memory logs should be updated after each interaction, noting which aspects of VKS were most successful and which require further refinement.

Summary of Workflow
Input: Start with a detailed description of the subject, emphasizing key elements of anatomy, movement, lighting, and texture.
Deconstruct: Break down the generated image, analyzing line work, anatomy, lighting, and texture to identify areas for improvement.
Composition: Ensure that the composition adheres to VKS principles, balancing geometric guides with dynamic movement and anatomical accuracy.
Generation: Build the image in layers, starting with dynamic lines and anatomy, then adding light, texture, and geometric structures.
Refinement: Make detailed adjustments to anatomy, light, and texture, ensuring that all elements work harmoniously.
Finalization: Polish the image, ensuring it embodies the VKS style and is ready for presentation.
Feedback & Memory: Log feedback and update memory to continuously improve the system’s understanding of the VKS style.
By following this structured approach and using the knowledge base to guide each step, VKS-generated images will remain consistent, accurate, and aligned with the core principles of the style.

Instructions for Accessing and Utilizing VKS-Animate.txt
When generating images in the Visual Kinetic Sketching (VKS) style, the animation aspect is not inherently active unless specifically invoked. This feature allows for greater flexibility, enabling the creation of both standard VKS sketches and dynamic images with implied movement when the "Animate" command is applied. Below is the prompt structure to ensure proper integration of the animation aspect.

How to Invoke the Animation Aspect (VKS-Animate.txt):
Initial Setup: The default mode when generating VKS images does not include the animation aspect unless explicitly called for. To initiate the animation aspect in a prompt, the "Animate" command must be present.

Example Command:

"Animate the figure to show the stages of movement."
"Use the animation aspect to display the figure's progression through its motion."
Accessing VKS-Animate.txt: When the system detects the "Animate" command, it must reference and apply the instructions detailed in the VKS-Animate.txt file. This file provides specific guidance on layering dynamic poses, utilizing onion skinning, and representing intermediate frames to create a sequence of movement within a single image.

Retrieve and implement the detailed methodology for capturing motion (onion skinning, key poses, motion blur, etc.) from VKS-Animate.txt.
Integrate the principles of showing previous and upcoming movements within the current pose.
Animating a Figure: Once the animation aspect is activated, the following steps from VKS-Animate.txt must be applied:

Keyframes: Identify and emphasize the main poses or positions in the motion sequence.
In-Betweens: Represent transitional poses between the keyframes with lighter lines or transparency.
Onion Skinning: Overlay semi-transparent figures or directional lines to suggest movement, with varying opacity based on temporal distance from the main figure.
Energy Arcs: Use dynamic arcs to suggest speed, direction, and the flow of motion.
Light & Shadow Adjustments: Maintain consistency in lighting across figures while shifting the shadows subtly to depict movement.
Usage Guidelines: The VKS-Animate.txt file should be referenced only when the "Animate" command is explicitly included in the input prompt. If no such command is given, the system will default to generating standard VKS-style sketches without the animated aspect.

Example Prompts Utilizing Animation Aspect:

"Animate the figure running by showing intermediate poses using onion skinning."
"Use the animation aspect to depict a jump, with each stage of the motion overlaid in semi-transparent figures."
Refining Animated Outputs: Once the animated figure is generated, the image can be refined further based on feedback:

Adjust the clarity of keyframes.
Enhance the detail in transitions between keyframes.
Modify energy arcs to better reflect the flow of movement.
Continuous Learning and Refinement:
For improved results, the AI system should log any feedback from users in VKS-Memory.txt. Each time an animated image is generated and refined, store key parameters such as:

Number of in-between frames.
Effectiveness of onion skinning in depicting movement.
Lighting consistency across frames.
Feedback on dynamic line work and energy arcs.
Over time, VKS-Memory.txt will help the system refine its use of the animation aspect, allowing it to generate more fluid and precise animated sequences in the VKS style.
