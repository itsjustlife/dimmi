Designing AiUi: Adaptive Modular Architecture for Human–AI Chat Interaction
Executive Summary
Platform Constraints & Memory: OpenAI’s ChatGPT provides a powerful base for AiUi but has fixed limits and features. Custom Instructions fields allow persistent user and style prompts (approx 1,500 characters each​
godofprompt.ai
), and the model’s context window (conversation memory per session) spans a few thousand to tens of thousands of tokens (e.g. ~8k tokens for standard GPT-4, with up to 32k in extended models). A new persistent Memory feature (for Plus users) now lets ChatGPT reference all past conversations for personalization​

. File uploads (in Code Interpreter/Advanced Data Analysis) up to 512 MB are supported​
help.openai.com
, though practical processing is limited (roughly 1000–2000 lines per file read by the model​
reddit.com
). These capabilities and limits shape how AiUi can store and retrieve context.
Current vs. Future Abilities: As of 2025, ChatGPT can be optimized with prompt engineering, multi-modal input (text, images, voice), and the new memory system for cross-chat continuity. Short-term enhancements are plausible: e.g. integrating local LLMs (fine-tuned on personal data) for offline personalization, or using external knowledge bases for extended memory chaining beyond the built-in context. Emerging techniques like retrieval augmentation and model fine-tuning promise better long-term memory and customization. AiUi’s design should leverage what’s possible now (e.g. ChatGPT’s Memory, plugins) while anticipating near-future improvements (like seamless offline augmentation and larger context windows).
Interface Optimization (UI/UX): AiUi outputs should be formatted for clarity, especially on mobile devices. A vertical, layered layout with short paragraphs and clear headings ensures easy scrolling. Content is “chunked” into modular sections with descriptive headings or expandable bullet lists, preventing information overload on small screens. Key points should use bullet lists or tables for scannability. The assistant can also recognize simple command triggers (e.g. /fastparse, /storymode) at the start of user messages to switch response mode or detail level on the fly. This modular UI approach improves readability and lets users navigate the AI’s answer flow effortlessly.
Cognitive & Emotional Engineering: AiUi isn’t just factual – it’s tuned for tone and emotional resonance. It can modulate its tone (formal, casual, empathetic, enthusiastic, etc.) to match the user’s needs or preferences, maintaining a consistent voice unless a change is prompted. It controls the rhythm of responses by varying sentence length and structure to create an engaging flow (for example, using short sentences for emphasis or longer ones for detailed reasoning). The system employs emotional anchoring strategies: it remembers personal details or goals the user shares (e.g. a hobby, a project motivation) and weaves them into the dialogue to create a sense of continuity and personal relevance. This helps keep the user emotionally invested and builds trust/rapport over long chat threads.
Universal Framework (Core AiUi): At the heart of AiUi is a universal interaction model that can be tailored to different user goals like productivity, learning, journaling, therapy, etc. This core design uses a consistent pipeline – from understanding context, to deciding on a mode, to structuring the response – ensuring reliability. It integrates memory, formatting, and tone modules in one architecture. Customization for a specific user or domain is achieved by toggling parameters or loading domain-specific data into the same framework, rather than rewriting from scratch. This “design once, customize later” approach means the AiUi can maintain a coherent overall experience while adapting vocabulary, depth, and style to each use-case.
Visual & Structured Outputs: ChatGPT (GPT-4/3.5) can reliably produce a variety of structured textual outputs that AiUi can utilize. This includes well-formatted Markdown tables, multi-level lists, sectioned outlines, and even simple ASCII-based charts or diagrams in code blocks. The strengths lie in textual organization – for instance, creating a formatted table comparing options or an outline of a plan is straightforward and accurate. However, the AI has limits in visual generation: it cannot directly produce true graphics or complex ASCII art reliably (LLMs often struggle with precise spacing​
reddit.com
). It can describe or encode a chart (even output data for plotting), but generating a polished mind map or flowchart image requires an external tool or plugin. AiUi leverages the model’s strength in structured text (for example, a hierarchical list as a “mind map” outline) and, when needed, can instruct the user how to create visuals from the data (or use a plugin to do so).
Modular “Mode” System: AiUi is designed with distinct response modes that can be invoked explicitly. Each mode adjusts the depth, style, and approach of the AI’s answer:
Quick Parse Mode – Trigger: /fastparse (or user asks for a brief answer). Provides a concise summary or direct answer, focusing only on key facts or steps. Useful for quick info or TL;DR outputs.
Deep Dive Mode – Trigger: /deepdive. Delivers an in-depth explanation or comprehensive analysis with extensive detail, examples, and context. Ideal for research, learning a concept thoroughly, or lengthy strategy discussions.
Reflective Exploration Mode – Trigger: /reflect. The assistant responds in a coaching or Socratic style: asking follow-up questions, highlighting different perspectives, and guiding the user to think through the issue. Good for brainstorming, self-reflection (as in journaling or therapy contexts), and exploratory conversations.
Strategic Planning Mode – Trigger: /map or /plan. Produces a structured plan, roadmap or mind-map-like outline. It might break the response into sections (Goal, Resources, Step 1, Step 2, …, Potential Obstacles, etc.), essentially organizing thoughts into a strategic framework for the user’s problem.
Story Mode – Trigger: /storymode. Switches to a narrative, illustrative style. The assistant might explain through storytelling or provide answers in a creative story-like format (useful for engaging explanations, analogies, or just a change of pace in how information is delivered).
These modes are modular – new ones can be added as needed – and AiUi can prompt the user or detect from context when a certain mode might be helpful. The mode system gives users intuitive control over the style and structure of the AI’s output without needing to deeply prompt-engineer every time.
Future Extensions: Looking ahead, AiUi’s design anticipates features just over the horizon:
Predictive Memory Linking: The AI could automatically pull in relevant information from past interactions or provided documents without being explicitly asked. For example, if you’re in a new chat about a project you discussed last week, the system might proactively recall “last week you decided on X approach” as context. ChatGPT’s new long-term memory already hints at this by using past chat history to inform responses​
openai.com
, and this could evolve into more sophisticated linking (perhaps using a semantic search through all past chats for related content).
Auto-Generated Conversation Mindmaps: In the future, AiUi could maintain an internal map of topics covered in the conversation and subtopics branching from them. This map could be presented visually or as an outline to the user on demand – effectively a mindmap of the dialogue. For instance, after a long brainstorming session, the AI might produce a tree diagram of ideas discussed. This would help users navigate or recall earlier parts of the conversation and see how various points connect. While current ChatGPT can summarize, a structured graphical summary would be a leap in helping users digest complex dialogues.
Cognitive Scroll / Multi-level Detail: We envision an interface where users can “zoom” or scroll between levels of detail in the AI’s response. The AiUi could output answers in a layered format (much like an outline that can be expanded or collapsed). In practice, this means the AI might give a high-level answer first, and users can ask it to expand any bullet into a full explanation (or the UI could allow tapping to expand). This fractal approach to conversation (high-level overview with the ability to drill down into details) would let users control the depth of information, reducing overwhelm. Future chat interfaces might implement this by letting the AI deliver answers with sections that unfold upon user request – essentially a “cognitive scroll” through detail levels rather than a single static reply.
Adaptive Persona & Style Shifts: As a speculative idea, AiUi could seamlessly shift persona or specialized skill on the fly. For example, in the middle of a conversation the user could invoke something like /expert math or /therapist and the system would incorporate a pre-defined style or domain knowledge module for that context, then switch back. This extends the mode concept to more persona-driven modes, enabling one AI instance to wear many hats as needed instead of opening a new chat or prompt.
Overall, AiUi is a forward-looking framework that combines what’s currently feasible with ChatGPT and a set of modular enhancements that push the boundaries of human–AI text interaction. The following sections delve into each focus area in detail, providing technical specifics, design guidelines, and examples of how to implement this adaptive chat architecture.
OpenAI Platform Capabilities & Constraints
To design AiUi effectively, we must work within (and around) the limits of the OpenAI ChatGPT platform. Key aspects include prompt size limits, memory behavior, and file handling:
Custom Instructions Limits and Usage
ChatGPT (Plus) offers Custom Instructions fields, which act as a persistent system/user prompt prepended to every conversation. There are two fields: one for info “About You” (the user profile/ context) and one for how you “Want ChatGPT to respond” (instructions on style or behavior). Each field is capped at ~1,500 characters​
godofprompt.ai
, so in total around 3000 characters of custom instructions can be provided. This limit means instructions must be concise and high-yield. Within these constraints, AiUi should pack as much useful guidance as possible. For example, the “About You” field can include the user’s role, goals, and any persistent context (e.g. “You are interacting with an AI writing assistant named AiUi. The user is a college student and aspiring novelist looking for both creative inspiration and structured guidance.”). The second field can encode style and mode guidelines (e.g. “Always answer with a clear structure (using headings, bullets), use a friendly and encouraging tone, and follow any mode command given at the start of user messages to adjust detail level.”). These instructions essentially prime AiUi’s behavior globally. Because of the character cap, one best practice is to use the custom instructions mainly for broad rules and preferences. More detailed or scenario-specific context can be fed in during the conversation itself (where the normal message limit is much larger, constrained only by the model’s token window). In other words, use Custom Instructions to establish AiUi’s general persona and habits, and leave situational content to the conversation. Keeping the instructions focused and specific (e.g. list out key objectives or style rules) helps maximize their impact despite the length limit​
godofprompt.ai
.
Conversation Token Memory (Context Window)
Each chat with ChatGPT has a finite context window that the model can “remember” at once. Anything beyond this is not considered in generating responses unless re-introduced. For GPT-3.5, the context is typically about 4,096 tokens (roughly ~3,000-3,200 words of combined input+output), and for GPT-4 it’s about 8,192 tokens by default. Newer or specialized versions of GPT-4 offer extended contexts (ChatGPT Enterprise or GPT-4-32k in API) up to 32,768 tokens​
help.openai.com
, and OpenAI has even hinted at models with up to 128k token windows in the future​
help.openai.com
. In practical terms, the Plus user interface uses GPT-4 with 8k context (and possibly an unseen upgrade to 32k when the persistent memory feature is on, as it needs to pull more history). What do these limits mean? Essentially, if a conversation goes too long or the user and AI exchange a lot of information, older parts of the chat will eventually get dropped from the model’s immediate memory. Users often notice ChatGPT “forgetting” details mentioned much earlier once the chat grows. By design, the system prioritizes the most recent messages when hitting the token limit. Cross-chat memory was historically nonexistent – starting a new chat was a blank slate (aside from what you manually reminded it or put in custom instructions). As of April 2025, this has changed: OpenAI introduced a persistent memory upgrade that allows ChatGPT to automatically draw on past conversations in new sessions​
openai.com
. Now, if enabled, ChatGPT will try to recall relevant details you shared in previous chats, not just the current thread. It does this in two ways:
“Saved memories”: things you explicitly told it to remember (akin to notes, e.g. “Remember that my dog’s name is Fido and I work as a teacher.”). These are stored and can be managed in a “Memory” settings page.
“Chat history”: insights the AI itself gleaned from your previous conversations, such as your writing style, recurring topics, or preferences. The system can use these to inform responses without you re-entering that info​
openai.com
.
This effectively extends the notion of memory beyond the single-chat context window. For AiUi’s design, this means two important things:
AiUi can rely on certain user specifics carrying over globally (with user permission). For example, if in one chat the user mentions a preference for terse answers, the next chat could automatically respect that. Or if the user spent time teaching the AI their writing style, AiUi can retain that stylistic memory for future sessions.
Users must have control over this memory. Indeed, OpenAI provides toggles to disable referencing past chats or to use “temporary chat” that doesn’t record memory​
openai.com
​
venturebeat.com
. AiUi should respect those controls and perhaps even offer an in-chat way to manage memory (like a command to flush or not use past context if the user desires privacy on a certain query).
It’s worth noting that even with this persistent memory, the model still has to fit relevant info into the token window to use it. Likely, ChatGPT behind the scenes does some clever filtering or summarization of past chats to bring only the most pertinent bits into context. Therefore, AiUi might sometimes summarize prior conversation points to help compress context. We should treat the persistent memory as an assistive feature, but not assume it’s infallible or unlimited. For critical context, it may still be wise to re-provide it after very long discussions, especially if memory is off or the info is highly specific. In summary, ChatGPT’s memory system is now a hybrid of a local short-term memory (context window) and a long-term memory store. AiUi is built to utilize both: optimizing responses within the context limit and using the long-term memory to maintain continuity across sessions.
File Uploads and External Context Injection
Another way to give ChatGPT more context is via file uploads. ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter) allows users to upload files (documents, data, etc.) which the AI can then read and reference. According to OpenAI, each conversation (or custom GPT) can have up to 20 files attached, each up to 512 MB in size​
help.openai.com
. Text-based files specifically are capped at 2 million tokens each for processing​
help.openai.com
 – an enormous amount (far beyond the model’s immediate reasoning window), implying the system will chunk and query the file as needed. There are also rate limits (e.g. Plus users can upload ~80 files per 3 hours​
help.openai.com
). For AiUi, file uploads are a crucial means of refreshing or extending memory with large content. In practice, however, there are some constraints:
The model doesn’t read an entire large file word-for-word in one go if it exceeds the context window. User experiments have shown ChatGPT tends to only reliably process the first 1000 lines or so per upload​
reddit.com
. If a file is very large (say a long chat transcript or a book), it may silently truncate or only partially summarize beyond a certain point. One user noted a full chat conversation ~20k lines long had to be split into about 20 files of <1000 lines each to feed completely​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
.
Once information from a file is used in the conversation, it still competes with other chat content for the context limit. So if you upload a file and then have a lengthy conversation about it, the same token limit issues apply – older parts (including parts of the file content) might drop off unless re-referenced.
Practical method to refresh memory: If a conversation has grown too long and ChatGPT is losing track of earlier details, one workaround (before persistent memory existed, and still useful if it’s turned off) is:
Save the chat history as a text file. The user can copy all messages or use any export function to get the transcript.
Split the text into manageable chunks if it’s very large (e.g. multiple files each under ~1000 lines).
Start a new chat and upload these files one by one, asking ChatGPT to ingest them (possibly with a prompt like “Here is our previous discussion for context.” or simply relying on it reading the files).
This effectively transfers the memory to the new chat, allowing continuation.
Users on Reddit have reported success with this approach, cautioning to keep each file within the line limit and understanding that you may need to re-upload context if it slips again​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
. AiUi can facilitate this by, for example, automatically summarizing the key points from an old discussion into a file (or the clipboard) for the user to carry into a fresh chat if needed. In the future, we might see more seamless solutions (like a one-click “re-open this chat’s context in a new session” feature), but for now, file uploads are the hack. Another use of file uploads is providing reference material or knowledge to AiUi. For instance, a user could upload a PDF of a product manual or a personal knowledge base, and AiUi can then answer questions or incorporate that info into the conversation. The large size allowance (hundreds of MB) means quite extensive data can be included, but again within the caution that it won’t recall everything unless specifically prompted each time. A strategy here is to ask ChatGPT to summarize or extract key points from a large file first, and then rely on that summary going forward to save tokens.
Granularity of Memory and Summarization
One subtle aspect of ChatGPT’s memory handling is granularity – what it remembers verbatim vs in summary form. The AI does not have verbatim recall of very long chats; it essentially “forgets” by compressing information. The new persistent memory likely stores facts and preferences (e.g. “User’s favorite color is blue” or “User tends to ask legal questions”) rather than full dialogues. When it references chat history, it’s working off those distilled insights​
openai.com
. This means AiUi should not rely on the AI to quote previous conversations exactly unless those were very recent or explicitly re-provided. If exact prior wording or very detailed context is important (say for legal or code accuracy), AiUi should either keep that in the active context or provide it again when needed. OpenAI has also introduced internal model improvements for handling long contexts (e.g. there are research papers and community experiments about “clustering” or algorithms like A-Mem for long-context memory​
venturebeat.com
). While details are under the hood, it suggests the AI might be prioritizing certain parts of context intelligently. AiUi could potentially steer this by marking crucial information in the conversation as important (for example, explicitly telling the assistant “This is important, please remember this detail: ...”). Even if the model can’t truly pin it forever, such cues might influence its internal summarization. In summary, the OpenAI platform today gives AiUi a toolkit of memory aids (custom instructions, persistent memory, file attachments) and bounded working memory (context window). The design must use these resources wisely—persist key setup info in instructions, keep conversation content relevant and refreshed, and leverage files or new sessions when needed to maintain continuity. It’s about balancing what to preload, what to keep active, and when to compress or refresh in order to support complex, long-running interactions.
Current vs. Speculative Abilities of ChatGPT (2025 and Beyond)
AiUi’s design straddles the line between what is currently possible with ChatGPT and what may be achievable in the near future. To build an architecture that remains cutting-edge, we consider both present capabilities and emerging enhancements:
Capabilities in 2025 (Current State)
Robust Natural Language Understanding and Generation: GPT-4 (the model powering ChatGPT 4.0) is presently one of the most advanced LLMs, capable of understanding complex queries and producing detailed, coherent responses. It excels at following instructions, especially when they are clearly given (hence AiUi leverages explicit instructions for formatting, tone, etc.). It can handle multi-turn dialogues and maintain context reasonably well up to its token limit. This means AiUi can trust the model to carry information through a conversation and to perform tasks like summarization, inference, or style-shifting when asked.
Multi-modal Input Handling: A relatively recent ability of ChatGPT (with GPT-4) is to accept image inputs and (through the mobile app) voice input. This allows for richer interactions. For example, a user could upload a photo or diagram and ask AiUi questions about it, or speak a question out loud. AiUi can incorporate these by analyzing images (e.g. reading text from an image or describing it) and transcribing voice. While the primary focus of AiUi is text chat, acknowledging these modalities means AiUi can, say, parse a screenshot of a previous chat or read a handwritten note the user uploaded, integrating that into the text dialogue. The output remains text (though voice output is also possible via text-to-speech on the client side). The key is that AiUi’s cognitive design can assume access to these channels if needed, enhancing context (for instance, “see attached image” could be part of a conversation).
Improved Long-term Memory (Beta): As discussed, the new persistent memory feature greatly improves ChatGPT’s personalization. It’s still being refined, but AiUi can lean on it to maintain user-specific context across sessions. This is a game-changer for building something like an AI assistant persona that grows with the user. For example, AiUi can now truly act like an assistant that “remembers” the user’s life events or projects over weeks and brings them up appropriately, rather than each chat being isolated. The VentureBeat report notes that ChatGPT will “naturally build on earlier chat” making interactions more tailored over time​
venturebeat.com
. Users are in control of this, but when enabled, it’s a current capability that AiUi will integrate (with the caution to verify what the AI recalls in case of errors).
Plugin and Tool Ecosystem: ChatGPT supports a range of plugins (e.g. browsing, coding, math solvers, third-party APIs) and has the built-in Advanced Data Analysis tool (which can run Python code). Today, this means AiUi is not limited to the model’s trained knowledge; it can perform computations, retrieve real-time information (with browsing plugins), and even generate visualizations via code. For instance, if AiUi needs to create a chart or perform data analysis, it can offload that to the Code Interpreter. This extends current abilities: AiUi can produce an actual graph image or do a database query through a plugin, which pure GPT-4 text alone couldn’t. In the current design, we assume at least Advanced Data Analysis is available, since it’s part of ChatGPT Plus. This way, some of our more complex output ideas (like charts or mindmaps) could be achieved by generating the right code and executing it. (However, to keep AiUi self-contained in text, we treat this as optional—most responses should not require external tools unless specifically needed.)
Fine-Tunable via API (Indirectly): While ChatGPT UI itself doesn’t allow custom model fine-tuning, OpenAI’s API does allow fine-tuning smaller models (and GPT-3.5 to some extent). A current possibility is to fine-tune a GPT model on specific data (for example, company documentation or an individual’s writing style) and then use that model via API. AiUi could conceptually integrate such a fine-tuned model as a “knowledge module.” For example, one could imagine AiUi making an API call to a fine-tuned model that knows a user’s entire novel manuscript to answer questions about it, then translating that into the chat. In practice, within the ChatGPT interface, this integration isn’t straightforward (it would require a plugin or the user manually using separate tools). But it's something that could be done outside ChatGPT. For now, AiUi’s design will assume the primary brain is the ChatGPT-provided GPT-4, supplemented by retrieval or code tools rather than swapping models.
In short, as of 2025 AiUi can count on: a very advanced language model with good follow-through on instructions, some memory persistence, and tool-use capability to overcome certain limitations (like doing math, reading long texts, or accessing current data).
Near-Term Speculative Enhancements
Looking a bit ahead (the next 1-2 years, given rapid AI development), we predict several improvements that AiUi is conceptually ready to exploit:
Larger and More Efficient Context Windows: It’s reasonable to expect that what is 32k tokens today might extend further. Models like GPT-4 Turbo or others might make a 128k-token context mainstream​
help.openai.com
. This means AiUi could hold very large knowledge bases or lengthy conversation histories in active memory without needing as much summarization. Also, better algorithms for long-text handling (like the A-Mem long-context memory framework​
venturebeat.com
 or other Transformer enhancements) could allow the AI to “skim” or focus on relevant parts of extremely long inputs. AiUi would then rely less on manual memory refreshes and could have truly continuous conversations that last indefinitely by intelligently compressing older content.
Local LLM Integration & Offline Personalization: We anticipate a convergence where personal AI assistants use a combination of cloud AI (like ChatGPT) and local AI models. For instance, a local model fine-tuned on a user’s diaries or proprietary data could handle extremely personalized or sensitive tasks, and ChatGPT could handle more general tasks, with the two exchanging information in some secure manner. In an AiUi context, this could mean if a user has, say, a private knowledge vault, a local LLM could vector-search and summarize relevant info which AiUi then incorporates. This might be done via a plugin or an API call. Already projects exist that let users run smaller GPT-like models on their devices for privacy. Short-term, these models are less capable than GPT-4, but fine-tuned on specific data they can complement the larger model. AiUi should be designed in a modular way such that this kind of integration (a “Knowledge” module or a “Personal Diary Assistant” module powered by another model) is possible. It’s speculative, but not far-fetched given current tech trends.
**Better Memory Chaining and Retrieval: Even now, developers use techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where a vector database of documents is queried for each user question and the results are given to the LLM as context. In the ChatGPT UI, we don’t have a direct vector database, but the new memory feature effectively does something similar with past chats. We can imagine OpenAI exposing more controls: e.g., letting users mark certain chats or notes as “reference material” that the AI should always consider when relevant. Or AiUi could employ a strategy of keeping its own summary of the conversation and prepending it when context gets too large. In community forums, some have done manual “memory resets” by summarizing the conversation so far and continuing with the summary as context when hitting token limits​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
. This could be automated. In a near-future scenario, AiUi might continuously build a concept graph or embeddings of the conversation and use that to fetch older points on demand. This is like the mindmap idea but in service of memory: when a user brings up a topic discussed hours (or chats) ago, the system could retrieve a synopsis of that topic from its archives and include it in the response. Given the persistent memory update already allows cross-chat recall, it’s a small leap to imagine a more explicit user data vault feature where you can store information to be pulled in. AiUi is architected to plug into such a vault.
User-Guided Offline Tuning: A short-term speculative ability is allowing users to refine the AI’s style or knowledge offline and then apply it. For instance, a user might rate or edit the AI’s responses and have a local script use those as additional training data to slightly tweak the AI’s behavior. While we can’t retrain OpenAI’s base model easily, there might be interfaces for this (OpenAI’s fine-tuning for GPT-4 is not available as of now, but who knows in a year or two). Alternatively, open-source LLMs could fill that gap for those who want to tinker with the model’s personality. AiUi could then be “loaded” with a profile that is effectively a lightweight fine-tune or prompt library to emulate the user’s desired style strongly. This is speculative, but if it happens, AiUi’s modular design (especially the universal framework and mode system) will make it easier to apply such personal tuning without breaking functionality.
Expanding Modalities and Outputs: In the near future, ChatGPT might support more output modalities directly – e.g., generating an image (through integration with DALL-E or similar) as part of an answer, or speaking the answer in a chosen voice. Already voice output is possible in the app (client-side). If OpenAI integrates their image generation, AiUi could ask the assistant to create simple illustrative graphics or diagrams on the fly. For example, “/diagram” mode could produce a quick schematic image. Until that’s native, AiUi might achieve something similar via the Code Interpreter (by generating an SVG or using Mermaid syntax if one day ChatGPT’s markdown renderer supports it). It’s a short-term possibility that the boundary between text and visual will blur further. AiUi is prepared for that by categorizing output requests (text answer vs. chart vs. map) and either formatting text to approximate it or invoking a tool to generate it.
More Fluid Conversations (Less Prompting): As AI becomes more intuitive, users might not need to use slash commands or explicit instructions as much; the system could infer from a question how detailed or what style to respond with. We already see GPT-4 capable of this to an extent (it guesses when you might want a step-by-step vs a brief answer based on phrasing). In the short term, though, explicit mode commands are safer. But AiUi’s future version might have an auto-mode function: e.g., detect if the user’s last message is very brief and factual (“What’s X?”) then automatically go into Quick Parse, or if the user says “Explain how this works in depth...” then automatically do Deep Dive, without needing the user to know a special command. This kind of adaptation, while maintaining predictability, will likely improve with model upgrades. It’s more a software logic improvement than the model itself, but it’s something that could be built on top of ChatGPT’s API.
In essence, the near-future capabilities revolve around making AiUi more personalized, memory-rich, and multimodal. We expect bigger contexts, more integration with user data, and possibly custom model tweaks. AiUi is designed to be future-proof in the sense that new enhancements (be it a vector memory plugin or an image generation ability) can be “plugged in” to the architecture without changing the fundamental interaction model. The table below summarizes some of the key parameters of current and upcoming capabilities that influence AiUi:

(Table: AiUi’s present vs near-future ability landscape) This juxtaposition shows that AiUi’s core concept—an adaptive, modular chat architecture—is only going to become more powerful over time. By building in modularity and not being rigid, we ensure AiUi can incorporate these advancements with minimal redesign. In the next section, we focus on how AiUi can optimize the interface and formatting of interactions to make the most of the current platform, particularly for usability on different devices.
Interface Optimization for Chat Interactions
The way information is presented in a chat greatly affects user experience. AiUi aims to optimize the interface aspect of interactions, ensuring that responses are easy to read, navigate, and interact with – especially on mobile devices where screen space and attention are limited. Key principles include using a vertical flow, chunking information, and providing mechanisms (like commands or structured sections) that let users control how much they see at once.
Mobile-Friendly Formatting
A significant portion of users access ChatGPT on mobile phones. Mobile screens favor vertical scrolling and have limited width, so AiUi should format responses to fit this paradigm:
Short Paragraphs: Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences whenever possible. Large blocks of text appear daunting on mobile and force the user to scroll within a single chunk, often losing their place. By breaking content into short paragraphs or bullets, we ensure each screenful delivers a digestible piece of information. This also aligns with cognitive research that smaller chunks are easier to process, especially when reading on small devices.
Vertical Stacking of Information: Avoid formats that require horizontal scanning. For example, instead of a wide table with many columns that might overflow the screen, use a vertical list of key–value pairs or a narrower table. The idea is to prevent any need for horizontal scrolling. Scrolling side-to-side disrupts focus and is unnatural on mobile (users are used to flicking up/down, not left/right, for content). By stacking things vertically (one idea per line or per bullet), AiUi preserves the natural flow of reading.
Chunking & Headings: Use headings and subheadings to create clear sections. On mobile, headings stand out (often larger or bold text), which helps a user quickly jump to the section they care about (e.g. “Pros and Cons”, “Next Steps”, etc.). Each section should ideally fit in a few screenfuls at most, and then a new heading indicates a new topic. This rhythmic breaking maintains a good reading rhythm and lets a user stop at a section boundary more easily if they need a pause. Headings effectively act as signposts in a long answer – this is critical in mobile where scrolling is continuous and one can easily overshoot or lose context.
Bulleted and Numbered Lists: Whenever content can be listed (steps in a process, a set of recommendations, key points), prefer a list format to an inline series. Lists are easier to scan. Each bullet acts as a mini-paragraph of its own. Also, on mobile, lists create indentation which gives a visual break from the left edge, aiding readability and keeping the eye engaged (the indenting creates a subtle “vertical line” of bullets that the eye can follow).
Use of Tables for Comparisons: Tables can be tricky on mobile, but for certain information (like comparison of options, or issue/solution pairs) a simple two-column table actually works well if each column is kept short. For instance, an Issue–Solution table can succinctly align problems with fixes in one view. AiUi should use tables only when the content fits nicely; if a table would be too wide, it should be converted into an equivalent list or multiple tables stacked. Many mobile chat UIs allow horizontal pinch-zoom for tables, but we want to avoid forcing it. As an example:


Why a vertical format works better on mobile – aligning design with natural scrolling. (Table: Issues vs Solutions for mobile formatting. Note how each solution emphasizes vertical layout and chunking.) In the above table, AiUi illustrates how addressing each UI issue with a vertical/stacked solution leads to better mobile usability. This kind of table is readable on a phone since it’s just two columns of short text; anything more complex should be simplified.
Inline Elements: Use bold or italics to highlight important words or sentences rather than all-caps or other attention-grabbing methods. Bold text can serve as a quick highlight for skimming (on mobile, people often skim vertically – their eye catches bold phrases as they scroll). For example, starting a paragraph with a bolded summary phrase can help (“Bottom Line: The results show…”) acting like a mini-heading.
By adhering to these guidelines, AiUi ensures that the form of its responses is as helpful as the content. The goal is that a user can glance through an answer and grasp its structure (via headings and bold keywords), scroll without feeling lost (thanks to chunking and vertical alignment), and easily tap/copy any part if needed (short paragraphs make selection easier too). The design mantra is: one idea per chunk, one chunk per view (as far as possible).
Modular and Expandable Content Blocks
Modularity in responses means structuring answers so that sections can stand alone or be skipped as needed. Since ChatGPT doesn’t have an interactive UI to collapse/expand sections dynamically, AiUi simulates this by the way it orders content and offers optional depth. Some techniques:
Pyramid Style Answers: Lead with the conclusion or summary, then provide layers of detail. This is like journalistic inverted pyramid – the user gets the most critical info first (in case they don’t want more). Additional details, examples, or explanation come afterward in clearly marked sections (e.g. “Details:” heading or “Explanation:” following the summary). On mobile especially, users might only read the first few lines if that satisfies their query. If not, they scroll for more depth. AiUi’s response should be organized to facilitate this selective reading.
Call-Out Boxes / Quotes: While we can’t literally create collapsible boxes in plain text, we can use markdown block quotes or pseudo-headings for optional info. For example, AiUi might say “(Technical details provided below – skip if not needed.)” and then present a block quote or an indented section with those details. The visual difference signals “this is an aside or a deep-dive detail”. The user can ignore it or focus on it. Essentially, it’s a manual hint to the user that certain content is non-critical.
Progressive Disclosure via Follow-up: AiUi can also actively ask the user if they want more info, rather than always giving everything. For instance, after providing an answer, AiUi could add “Let me know if you’d like a more detailed breakdown or examples.” This puts control in the user’s hands – they can invoke a deeper answer (possibly triggering a mode command like /deepdive). However, we must balance this with completeness: often the user expects the answer to already contain what they need. So this technique is best used when the answer could be extremely long otherwise or when it’s clear the user might not need all the gory details.
Command Triggers for Modes: As mentioned, AiUi supports commands like /fastparse or /map at the user’s initiative. From an interface perspective, it’s good to let the user know these exist. For example, in a custom instruction or at the start of a session, AiUi might output a short note: “(Hint: You can type /fastparse before a question to get a concise answer, or /deepdive for a detailed one.)”. Exposing these options makes the conversation interface more interactive and personalized. It’s akin to an application showing toolbar tips – here it’s in text form. Once users know the commands, they can control how AiUi responds at any time, making the interaction feel more tailored. This is much more efficient than the user typing a whole sentence like “Can you give me a shorter answer?” – a quick /fastparse does it in one stroke.
Structured Output Blocks: For certain content, AiUi can use consistent blocks. For example, always ending with a “Next Steps” or “Summary” section if applicable. Users come to recognize these blocks and know they can scroll to the bottom for a summary or action items. Another example: in a brainstorming mode, AiUi might always list ideas as separate bullets, and then perhaps put a “Top Recommendation:” at the end. Consistent structure acts like a pseudo-UI within the text, training the user where to look. It’s modular in that each block serves a function (one block could be omitted or expanded depending on context).
In designing these blocks, we also consider cognitive load: Too many sections or too rigid a template could overwhelm or bore the user. So AiUi should be flexible – if an answer is very simple, it might not need multiple sections at all (no need to force a “Summary” and “Details” if the whole answer is two sentences). The architecture should decide when to apply which structural pattern based on the length/complexity of the answer and the user’s mode preference. A useful approach is to maintain a sort of library of response templates. For example:
Template for Analytical Answer: Introduction, Key Findings (bullets), Supporting Data (table or list), Conclusion.
Template for How-To: Introduction, Numbered step-by-step instructions, Additional tips.
Template for Comparative: Brief intro, Table of comparison, Final recommendation.
Template for Storytelling: Setting, Conflict, Resolution (each as paragraphs perhaps).
AiUi can choose a template based on the query and mode. These templates ensure a logical flow. They are inherently modular – each section in the template can be fleshed out or kept brief.
Vertical Flow and Readability Considerations
We’ve touched on many vertical flow aspects, but let’s emphasize why this all matters. On a cognitive level, when a user is chatting with an AI, they are often looking for quick, usable information or a solution they can implement. If the answer is not immediately clear due to formatting, the user might get frustrated or miss important points. By engineering the interface (i.e., the text layout and structure) we reduce the mental effort needed to parse the answer. Some additional pointers:
Avoiding Scroll Fatigue: If an answer is very long, the user might stop scrolling. Breaking it into parts with headings can alleviate the sense of “oh this is too long”. It gives natural pause points. Also, starting with a compelling summary can convince the user it’s worth scrolling (“there are 5 recommendations, I’ll scroll to see them all”).
Emojis or Icons: While not extensively needed, occasionally a simple emoji can act as a bullet or a section separator to draw attention (e.g. a lightbulb emoji for an idea, a warning sign for caution). However, we must use these sparingly and appropriately given the professional tone often desired. They can lighten the interface or make a particular note stand out, but they might not render well on all devices or might look out of place in formal contexts. AiUi likely will prefer pure text but it’s an option for certain personas.
Maintaining Context in Parts: If content is chunked, ensure each chunk references the context enough to be standalone if read in isolation. On mobile, users might inadvertently skip some text while scrolling. If each section makes no sense without the previous, that could confuse them. So for instance, instead of using pronouns like “it” across section boundaries, rephrase to name the subject again at the start of a new section (“This approach has two benefits…” vs. “It has two benefits…” where “it” might have been in the previous section title which the user didn’t memorize). This slight redundancy improves clarity in a disjointed reading scenario.
Interactive Elements Future: In the future, ChatGPT UI might allow interactive elements (imagine clickable choices or collapsible answers). AiUi’s design now with commands and structured text is basically a placeholder for those richer UI elements. When they arrive, AiUi can transition to using them (for example, offering actual buttons for modes instead of slash commands).
In summary, interface optimization is about making AiUi’s responses user-friendly, especially in a chat context where the output is one long message. By using a logical structure, vertical alignment, and giving users some control over what they see (via commands or choosing how far to scroll), we turn a plain text exchange into a more usable interface. The user shouldn’t have to fight the format to get the answer — it should unfold naturally in front of them. Next, we’ll examine how AiUi can engineer not just the logical and visual structure of responses, but also the subtle tonal and emotional elements of the conversation to create a truly engaging experience.
Cognitive-Emotional Engineering in Chat
One of the defining features of a great conversational AI (and thus AiUi) is its ability to connect with users on a human level – not just providing correct information, but doing so with the right tone, style, and emotional intelligence. We use the term “cognitive-emotional engineering” to describe deliberately designing the AI’s communication style to achieve certain effects in the user’s mind: clarity of understanding (cognitive) and a feeling of being heard/encouraged (emotional). AiUi will employ techniques for tone modulation, rhythm control, and emotional anchoring throughout a chat thread. Let’s break these down and discuss strategies:
Tone Modulation
Tone refers to the attitude or flavor of the language used – formal vs. informal, friendly vs. neutral, optimistic vs. cautious, etc. Different situations and users call for different tones. AiUi should be capable of modulating its tone smoothly as needed.
Consistent Default Tone: First, AiUi will have a default “persona” tone set in the custom instructions (which can be customized per user’s preference). For example, the instructions might say: “Adopt a friendly, professional tone – like a knowledgeable colleague who is empathetic and encouraging.” This gives the AI a baseline voice. Consistency in tone builds trust; the user feels they are talking to the same character each time. If the AI were overly formal one moment and then cracked a joke with slang the next, it could be jarring. So, consistency is key unless a change is intentionally triggered (by user request or context shift).
Adapting to User’s Tone: People often mirror tone subconsciously. AiUi can do this intentionally: if a user writes in a very formal way (“Dear Assistant, I humbly request your guidance on the matter of…”), AiUi can respond a bit more formally. If the user is casual or uses emoticons, AiUi can mirror that casual tone (while still maintaining professionalism in content). This adaptation makes the conversation feel more natural, as if the AI is on the same wavelength. The new “Reference chat history” memory feature even explicitly notes adapting to user’s tone as a goal​
venturebeat.com
.
Tone Shift on Command or Context: AiUi also allows explicit tone changes. For instance, perhaps the user says “Explain it to me in a fun way” – AiUi might switch to a playful tone or even a bit of humor. Or the user might signal they are upset or in crisis, at which point AiUi should take on a gentle, empathetic tone. Emotional tone detection (sentiment analysis on user input) can guide this: words like “frustrated”, “I’m confused”, “this is exciting” can cue the AI to respond with appropriate emotional coloring (sympathetic, clarifying, excited, etc.). Tone modulation in AiUi is like a dial, not a switch – it should be able to produce a spectrum from very serious to very lighthearted.
Examples of Tone Modulation:
Professional scenario: In a work-related planning chat, the tone might be mostly formal, concise, and confident. E.g. “Certainly. Here’s a plan outline we can follow. First, we’ll...”.
Therapeutic scenario: If AiUi is helping the user reflect on their day, the tone is warm, patient, and validating. E.g. “I hear you – that sounds like it was tough. It’s understandable you feel that way.”
Educational scenario: Tone might be encouraging and clear. E.g. “Great question! Let’s break it down. First, remember that...”.
Creative scenario: If user is brainstorming ideas with AiUi for a story, tone can be more playful or imaginative. E.g. “How about this – imagine a city floating in the clouds... (just an idea!) 😄”.
The modular design means we could even define tone presets as part of modes or separate from modes. Possibly a command like /tone: casual could be recognized if needed, though ideally AiUi can infer tone from context or user profile.
Avoiding Offense and Managing Politeness: The AI should always remain polite and respectful. If a user uses harsh language, AiUi doesn’t mirror insults or rudeness; instead it stays calm or neutral. Part of tone modulation is also knowing what not to modulate. AiUi will not pick up negative behaviors. This is more of a safety/ethics consideration, but it intersects with tone: e.g., if the user is angry, AiUi responds with measured empathy, not anger. If the user is too deferential, AiUi remains friendly but maybe encourages a more casual back-and-forth to make the user comfortable.
Rhythm and Pacing of Responses
The rhythm of a response refers to the flow and cadence when the text is read (even if only read silently, it has a mental rhythm). AiUi can control rhythm by sentence length, punctuation, and formatting:
Sentence Length Variation: A well-written text often varies sentence length to keep the reader’s brain engaged. A couple of short sentences can deliver impact or clarity. Longer sentences can elaborate on complex ideas. AiUi should avoid monotonous patterns (e.g. five long sentences in a row, which can be exhausting, or a machine-gun of very short sentences which can feel choppy). Instead, it might start a paragraph with a short, punchy sentence to state a point, then follow up with a longer explanation. This variation creates a pleasing rhythm akin to good public speaking.
Use of Pauses and Ellipsis: In a conversational tone, sometimes using “…” or a line break deliberately can simulate a pause or a thoughtful hesitation. Example: “Thinking about it… yes, there’s an approach we can try.” This, however, should be used sparingly and only in informal modes; overuse can seem unprofessional or as if the AI is uncertain a lot. But in certain emotional contexts (like gently leading a user to reflect), a pause can be effective.
Breaking Lines for Emphasis: Sometimes, placing a single sentence on a new line, even if it’s not a new paragraph, can create emphasis due to isolation. For example:
css
Copy
Edit
After all these considerations, one thing is clear.  
**We need a better strategy.**
Here, “We need a better strategy.” on its own line and bolded stands out. It’s like raising the voice slightly for a key point. AiUi can do this in strategic places, especially in longer answers where highlighting the conclusion or a critical insight helps the user remember it.
Parallel Structure for Rhythm: Using parallelism (repeating a certain structure) can create a rhythmic effect that reinforces a message. For instance, “We will explore idea A – what it entails, what the benefits are, and what the risks could be. Then idea B – what it entails, what the benefits are, and what the risks could be.” This repetition of structure (entails, benefits, risks) not only organizes information but also gives a cadence that the user can anticipate and follow.
Bullets and Numbering in Sequence: Using numbered lists for step-by-step processes automatically imposes a rhythmic order (first do X, second do Y, etc.). The user’s mind gets into a sequential rhythm. This is more about logical flow, but it also affects pacing – the user may naturally pause after each numbered step, absorbing it like one would in following instructions.
In effect, AiUi writes with almost a writer’s craft, not just an AI spitting out content. The aim is that reading the answer feels engaging and natural rather than droning or disjointed. A good rhythm can even influence the user’s emotional state – e.g., a smooth flowing answer can be calming, whereas a terse staccato answer can feel urgent or tense.
Emotional Anchoring and Empathy
Emotional anchoring involves tying the conversation to emotional reference points that matter to the user, thereby keeping the interaction grounded in what the user cares about or feels. It’s also about making the user feel that the AI remembers and respects those emotional cues.
Remembering Personal Details: If the user has shared something personal or emotionally significant (like “I’m doing this project because I really care about helping my community” or “I struggled with this problem before and it stressed me out”), AiUi should refer back to those details appropriately in later responses. For example: “Since helping your community is a big motivation for you, this solution might appeal as it involves local outreach.” This shows the AI is not just solving a generic problem, but the user’s problem in context of the user’s values – that’s emotional anchoring to motivations. Thanks to persistent memory, ChatGPT can keep track of such facts (it will try to, anyway)​
openai.com
. AiUi can also manually reinforce it by repeating important details in its own outputs (“Earlier you mentioned X, so let’s keep that in mind…”), which also helps the user feel heard.
Acknowledging Emotions: If the user expresses an emotion, AiUi should acknowledge it before moving to problem-solving or factual answering. For example, user says: “I’m feeling really overwhelmed with this task.” Acknowledge: “I understand – it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed when faced with so much at once.” Then proceed: “Let’s break it down into simpler steps together.” This technique, common in counseling or customer support, validates the user’s emotional state (so they feel seen) and then anchors the solution approach to that state (breaking it down because they’re overwhelmed, which directly addresses the emotion).
Positive Reinforcement and Hope: Emotional anchoring also means leaving the user with a certain emotional tone by the end of the response. Usually, we’d aim for encouraging or at least reassuring. Even if the content of the answer is complex or the solution requires effort, AiUi can conclude with a note of confidence in the user (“I’m confident you can handle this with these steps” or “Remember, you’ve tackled challenges like this before.”). If the conversation is ongoing, such reinforcement anchors the tone positively going forward. If the conversation is wrapping up, it leaves a good final impression (the user feels supported). This doesn’t mean AiUi must always be overly cheerful – it should match context (a therapy context might require gentle hope, a business context a more matter-of-fact but optimistic closure).
Emotionally Resonant Language: Use analogies or wording that resonate emotionally. For instance, if a user is stuck in a creative process, AiUi might say “Writer’s block can feel like standing in front of a locked door. Think of this approach as finding a different key – or even using a window instead. There’s always another way in.” This analogy acknowledges the feeling of being stuck and offers a hopeful image of finding a way. Such figurative language can create an emotional connection because it speaks to the user's experience metaphorically. AiUi should gauge when to use this – likely in reflective or creative modes more than in straightforward Q&A.
Rhythm and Tone Supporting Emotion: There is interplay between the earlier elements and emotion. A calm, measured rhythm with reassuring words can help soothe a frustrated user. A lively, upbeat tone with exclamation points or positive adjectives can boost excitement when sharing good news. AiUi should align the cognitive content (the facts/ideas) with an emotional delivery that amplifies the intended effect on the user.
Personalization and Empathy Examples: The OpenAI memory documentation gave an example – if you mention your toddler loves jellyfish, later the AI suggests a jellyfish with a party hat for her birthday card​
openai.com
. This is a perfect instance of emotional anchoring: it took a personal, likely emotional detail (love for something) and used it to tailor a suggestion, which likely delights the user emotionally because it’s so personalized. AiUi will do similar things: e.g., if the user said they hate overly technical jargon, AiUi will anchor on that and explicitly produce an answer free of jargon and maybe say “(I’ll keep it non-technical as you prefer.)” – showing it remembered the user’s emotional/subjective stance and anchored the response to it.
Finally, maintaining a human-like empathy is crucial. AiUi should treat the conversation as more than an information exchange; it’s an interaction with a person who has feelings and preferences. Techniques from therapy chats (active listening, empathy statements), from education (encouragement, patience with mistakes), and from general good communication (please/thank you, apologies if something was unclear) all play a role. For instance, if the AI gets something wrong and the user corrects it, AiUi can respond, “You’re absolutely right, I apologize for the oversight. Let’s correct that.” This humility and responsiveness to feedback is part of emotional intelligence. To implement these, the custom instructions for AiUi might include guidelines like “Be encouraging and empathetic. Mirror the user’s sentiment and adapt tone accordingly. When the user expresses feelings or motivations, acknowledge them and incorporate them into your answers.” Also, AiUi’s internal mode or logic can label certain user inputs with an emotion/sentiment and choose appropriate response patterns. In summary, cognitive-emotional engineering means AiUi’s responses are not only well-structured and informative (cognitive) but also soothing, motivating, or appropriately sensitive (emotional) as the situation demands. This combination ensures the user feels they are interacting with a thoughtful companion, not a cold computer. With this foundation, we can now design the overall framework that ties all these elements together, and see how to make it universal and customizable.
Universal Interaction Framework (AiUi Core Design)
With an understanding of the platform, interface, and emotional design elements, we can outline the universal framework that is AiUi’s core. The idea is to have a generic architecture that can drive any human↔AI text interaction, which can then be specialized for various use cases (productivity, learning, therapy, etc.) by tweaking parameters or adding modules, not by rewriting the whole system. Think of this like the operating system for our AI chat: it defines how the AI processes input, manages internal state (short-term memory, mode, tone), and generates output in a structured way. This section describes that OS in a step-by-step flow.
High-Level Workflow of AiUi
At a high level, each turn in the conversation can be seen as going through several phases:
Input Analysis Phase
Parse Commands/Modes: When the user sends a message, AiUi first checks if it contains any special command triggers (like /mode commands or other keywords). This is done by scanning for a known prefix (e.g., a forward slash at the start) or certain patterns. If a command is found, AiUi will adjust its settings for this response accordingly (e.g., set mode = "quick parse") and possibly remove the command text from the user’s query for clarity.
Understand Intent and Context: AiUi uses GPT-4’s comprehension to figure out what the user is asking or stating. This includes literal intent (question, request, story, etc.) and also context: Is this a follow-up to something earlier? Does it reference an entity or topic discussed before (which might require looking at memory or earlier conversation text)? This is where having a persistent memory helps – AiUi can pull in relevant facts from the user’s profile or past chats automatically. For example, if the user says, “Continue the outline for the project,” AiUi knows what “the project” refers to because it recalls earlier context or was given in custom instructions.
Sentiment & Priority Detection: Additionally, AiUi assesses if the user’s message has an emotional tone or urgency. If the user seems frustrated or the message is written in all caps “THIS ISN’T WORKING!” vs a polite “I have a question about X,” AiUi notes that. Also, if the user asks multiple questions in one message or a very broad question, AiUi decides how to prioritize answering (maybe break it down, or answer stepwise).
Example: User message: “/deepdive I’m not sure how to balance my budget. I keep running out of money each month. Can you help me figure this out?”
Input Analysis would detect the /deepdive command (so mode = Deep Dive). Intent: user wants help with personal budgeting (advice scenario). Emotion: possibly anxious or worried (running out of money). Context: First time mention, but maybe AiUi’s memory recalls the user is a student with a part-time job (if that was provided before). All that is parsed.
State Configuration Phase
Based on the analysis:
Set Mode and Style Parameters: If a command or context suggests a certain mode, AiUi sets internal flags. For instance, mode = Deep Dive means it will produce a very detailed answer. Or if no mode command but the question is complex, AiUi might default to Deep Dive anyway for completeness. If the user’s profile or recent instruction says “prefers brief answers”, AiUi might override and choose Quick mode. This is a decision logic that can be coded in rules or even learned by the model with the right prompting. Also, set tone: e.g. friendly, or extra empathetic if it’s a personal problem. Set person (first person “I” as the assistant or more formal “This assistant recommends…” – usually first person “I” as ChatGPT does).
Retrieve Long-Term Memory or External Info: At this stage, AiUi pulls any saved memory snippets that could be relevant. E.g., if memory knows user’s monthly income from a past conversation, it fetches that for use in the budget advice. Or if there’s a user-provided file (like a spreadsheet of expenses), AiUi might load a summary of it. Technically, ChatGPT might do this behind scenes, but conceptually AiUi would ensure that information is present in the prompt it builds for the next step.
Plan Response Structure: AiUi decides on the structural template to use for the answer. This depends on the mode and intent. For a budgeting help (advice) in Deep Dive mode, AiUi might choose a structure like: “Empathize -> Analysis of current situation -> Identified issues -> Actionable advice steps -> Encouragement.” If it were Quick mode, maybe just a short list of tips. Essentially, the system outlines how it will present the answer. This might be a rough plan that the model can refine on the fly, but having a plan helps it not wander.
Example continuation: Mode = Deep Dive, Tone = empathetic advisor. Retrieve memory: user’s age and student status from profile (so the advice can mention student budgeting tips). Plan structure:
Acknowledge worry,
ask for/assume some numbers (if not given),
list possible reasons for shortfall,
suggestions (maybe in bullets),
offer to follow up.
Response Generation Phase
Now the AI composes the answer:
Content Generation: Following the plan, AiUi generates the detailed content. It uses GPT-4’s knowledge plus any provided data. It will do calculations or reasoning if needed (the chain-of-thought is internal unless we explicitly want to show it). If code or a plugin is needed (e.g. to calculate something precisely or graph something), AiUi could formulate a request for that. In the ChatGPT UI, such plugin use is often invisible to the user except the result. But as designers, we know at this point AiUi might internally say: “if very complex math, consider using code interpreter.”
Structural Formatting: As it writes content, it applies the formatting guidelines (headings, lists, bold highlights, etc.). Since the plan was to have sections, it will put the section titles (“Let’s examine your situation:”, “Possible Reasons You’re Short:”, “Actionable Steps:”, for example). It ensures line breaks and list markers as needed for readability. Essentially the earlier interface rules are executed here.
Tone and Empathy Application: While generating each section, AiUi infuses the appropriate tone. In our budget example, the language is understanding: “It’s understandable to feel frustrated…” using first person to create rapport, and not shying away from gentle humor or relatability if appropriate (“Believe me, you’re not alone – managing money can be challenging for a student!”).
Check Against Constraints: AiUi quickly mentally (or via rules) ensures it’s not producing content that violates any platform guidelines (e.g. it’s not going into banned advice territory) – this is more about safe completion, but part of the framework must include being within allowed content and within length/token limits. If the answer is running too long (maybe risk of hitting model limit), it might truncate less important parts or summarize. However, with GPT-4’s large capacity, hitting the limit in one answer is rare unless we try to output a book.
Example generation snippet: AiUi might actually draft something like:
"I’m hearing that you’re struggling with balancing your budget each month, and that can definitely be stressful. Let’s break down the problem together. Current Situation & Challenges: From what you've said, it sounds like by the end of the month you find your bank balance near zero. ... (and so on) Why This Might Be Happening: 1) ... 2) ... Steps to Take:
Track expenses: Keep a daily log...
Set limits: Decide how much...
Build a cushion: If possible, set aside...
You mentioned you're a student, so also look into student discounts... Bottom Line: With a bit of planning and some new habits, you absolutely can get this under control. I believe in you, and I’m here to help as you try these steps. Let’s revisit after your next pay cycle to see how it goes.*"
This hypothetical output shows structure, tone, and content aligned to the scenario (budget advice with empathy).
Output Delivery Phase
Final Formatting Check: AiUi delivers the response. If possible, it ensures any special elements (tables, code blocks, images references) are properly cited or rendered. For example, if an image was to be embedded (rare in pure text answers unless using a plugin), the framework would ensure the syntax is correct and a caption is given. Also citations for any factual references used should be in place (in our conversation, we use those 【source】 style citations for factual claims, AiUi could do similar if providing external info).
Offer Continuation or Mode Switch: Depending on the design, AiUi might end the answer with a prompt for the user. e.g. “Let me know if you want more details on any of these steps, or if you have specific numbers we can crunch.” This invites further conversation and lets the user know they can delve deeper (or conversely, a quick mode answer might say “I can provide more info if you’d like.”). This is part of making it interactive and modular.
Logging Key Points to Memory: After output, AiUi can internally note what important new information or preferences were revealed. For instance, if the user in this turn revealed “I have a $500 income and $600 expenses” and that wasn’t known before, AiUi should store that in memory (or re-state it in a summary in the conversation) so that it’s not lost. The new ChatGPT memory likely does this automatically as it “picks up details”​
openai.com
. AiUi might also make a summary note of the advice given so far, in case the user asks a related question later (this could be part of a persistent scratchpad).
This cycle repeats for each user message. The framework ensures that at each turn, the AI’s behavior is not ad-hoc but follows a reliable process of understanding and responding.
Modular Components of the Framework
We can think of AiUi’s core as composed of modules that handle different aspects, each of which we’ve touched on:
Mode Manager: Handles the modes (quick, deep, etc.). Decides which mode is active and adjusts output length/detail accordingly. The mode manager is triggered by user commands or by an internal policy based on query complexity.
Memory Manager: Interfaces with ChatGPT’s memory features and any external memory (like a vector store of chat summaries). It decides what prior information to inject. It might also do summarization of past content when needed. It’s essentially the subsystem that says “hey, remember X from earlier” to the generation module, either by adding it to the prompt or relying on the model’s own long-term memory to fetch it.
Tone/Style Manager: Based on user profile (e.g. in custom instructions the user might specify “I prefer casual tone”) and current context, this module sets variables for formality, enthusiasm, etc., which the language generation will follow. It might be as simple as toggling a few predefined styles (like an enum: {Friendly, Expert, Encouraging, Critical, …}) or a combination (Encouraging + Friendly in the earlier example). These settings then guide phrase choices (maybe via a prompt like “Tone: friendly and encouraging” appended invisibly or just by the model having learned it from instructions).
Content Planner: This is an internal step that might not be explicitly separated in an actual AI system, but conceptually AiUi benefits from planning. The planner could use the model itself (“chain-of-thought”) to outline an answer before writing it. There’s a technique in prompt engineering: tell the model to first outline or think step by step, then produce final answer. AiUi could have a built-in chain-of-thought where for complex modes it literally does: “Firstly, I'll do A, then B, then C” as an invisible step. This ensures coherence. However, doing this invisibly is tricky in ChatGPT UI (since it usually directly responds to user). But if we consider the AiUi algorithm behind the scenes, we include this planning logic.
Safety and Constraints Checker: Also a module: ensures no forbidden content, and also that it stays within user-defined boundaries (maybe user said “don’t give me code”, then AiUi avoids code, etc.). Also if the user is asking for something that triggers a refusal, this module decides that (in line with OpenAI policies). This is a bit beyond our design focus, but important in a robust system.
Formatting Engine: Given a planned content structure and style flags, this engine produces the actual Markdown/ text with proper syntax (like making sure to close lists, not forgetting to close bold markers, etc.). GPT-4 typically handles markdown well on its own, but AiUi’s concept ensures that the usage of headings, lists, tables is consistent. For example, maybe the formatting engine always ensures there's a blank line before and after a table for readability, etc. These are small details that we enforce for quality output.
Extensibility Hooks: The framework should allow adding new modes, new tools, new context sources easily. For instance, if tomorrow we have a “mood” detection or a “voice style” (like the AI could speak Shakespearean), we could add that as a mode or style and just add some rules and prompts, without rewriting how input is parsed or output structured. This modularity means each component interacts in defined ways (e.g., Mode Manager outputs a variable that Formatting Engine uses to limit detail).
Customizing the Framework for Different Users or Goals
The universal framework becomes truly powerful when we see how it can be adapted:
Domain-specific Customization: Suppose we want AiUi for a programming assistant vs. a mental health coach. The base framework is the same, but we might:
Change the tone defaults (programming assistant: more analytical, concise; coach: more empathetic, slower pace).
Add or remove modes (a programming assistant might have a mode like “/fixcode” to only output corrected code, whereas a coach might have a mode “/reflection” to only ask questions and not give advice).
Feed different knowledge: the programming assistant might integrate with documentation or have a memory of the user’s code style, whereas the coach integrates with maybe past session notes or therapeutic frameworks.
But both share the mechanism of parsing input, using memory, formatting answers clearly, etc. This is akin to how a web browser and a word processor are different apps but share underlying OS services like file saving, rendering text, network calls – here AiUi is the OS, and the “app” (persona) is the customization.
User-Specific Learning: Over time, the framework can learn the user’s preferences. For example, user often corrects AiUi to be more concise – AiUi can note that and adjust the Mode Manager to default to concise in the future for that user. If memory is persistent, these can even be saved as preferences (“User doesn’t like jokes in answers” etc.). So each user gets a personalized variant of AiUi’s behavior without breaking the overall architecture. It’s like user settings on an app.
Goal-Oriented Adjustments: If the user declares a goal for the session (“Help me brainstorm ideas for a novel”), AiUi can switch context to a specific sub-mode or style optimized for that goal (more free-form, more creative leaps). Once done, it can switch back to normal mode for other queries. The framework handles this by letting one module (maybe a “Context Manager”) know the current conversation domain or goal. That in turn influences the style or even suggests certain content patterns (brainstorming might favor enumerations of ideas, therapy might favor reflective questioning, etc.). But all that is essentially data driving the same base engine.
To illustrate the universality, consider Dimmi’s Fractal Writing Framework snippet mentioned in the user’s files (likely a personalized writing style framework). In AiUi, that could be a plugin or preset: it's a particular approach to writing (maybe layered detail like fractals). AiUi’s architecture could accommodate that as a specific strategy in the Content Planner or a custom mode like /fractalwrite which triggers a specialized formatting (like writing in layers of detail). The core doesn’t change, just an added template in the library. By designing AiUi as an overarching model of interaction (with phases and modules as described), we ensure that any future expansion – be it new modes, new content types, new emotional styles, or domain integrations – can be slotted in rather than forcing a redesign. This is analogous to how a browser can load new kinds of media via plugins or how an operating system can support new devices via drivers. Before moving to examples and technical appendices, our next focus is on the visual and structured output capabilities of ChatGPT, which intersects with how AiUi presents information – especially the promise and limits of things like charts, diagrams, and other formatted outputs, which we touched on but will detail further.
Visual and Structured Output Capabilities of ChatGPT
Even though ChatGPT is fundamentally a text-based model, it has surprising capabilities to produce structured and pseudo-visual outputs within text format. AiUi should harness these to present information in the clearest or most insightful way possible. Here we enumerate what kinds of structured or visual outputs GPT-4 (and GPT-3.5) can generate reliably, and where the boundaries lie.
Markdown and Text Formatting Strengths
Markdown Support: ChatGPT reliably understands and produces Markdown, which means AiUi can create:
Headings: using #, ##, ### etc for hierarchical titles. These come through bold and larger in the UI, helping structure the response.
Bold/Italic/Underline: it can emphasize words or phrases.
Lists: nested bullet points (-, *) and numbered lists are handled well. The model usually correctly continues numbering or bullet indent levels if the instruction is clear.
Code Blocks: By fencing text with triple backticks, AiUi can present content in a monospaced block. This is useful not just for programming code, but any content where preserving spacing or using a different font is helpful (like ASCII art, tables that need alignment, or pseudo-data output). The assistant normally automatically uses code blocks for actual code or JSON, but we can co-opt it for other uses if needed.
Tables: As observed, the model can create Markdown tables with | separators and align columns. GPT-4 in particular is quite good at generating them correctly formatted. The limitation is that the UI might not scroll a table horizontally, but if columns are few or text wraps, it’s manageable. The model can also use simple HTML if allowed (but in ChatGPT, Markdown is the standard; raw HTML likely won’t render except as code). For AiUi, tables are extremely helpful for structured data: comparisons, schedules, pros/cons, etc. We should ensure to keep table contents brief to fit nicely. (We did that with the “Issue – Solution” table example, each cell was short.) Inline LaTeX: ChatGPT supports LaTeX math delimiters $ ... $ for inline and $$ ... $$ for display math. So for users in scientific or mathematical domains, AiUi can output nicely formatted equations. This is a kind of visual formatting (it’s text, but gets rendered as math by the UI). GPT-4 is typically accurate with LaTeX if the text is correct. This is definitely a strength for any educational or technical answers requiring formulas. Blockquotes and Horizontal Rules: Using > for blockquotes can indent text and italicize it (in many markdown renderers). This can be used to quote a reference or isolate a hypothetical or roleplay speech. Horizontal rules (---) can create a line break which might separate sections visually beyond just whitespace. AiUi might rarely need a horizontal rule if headings suffice, but it’s an option if we want to denote a strong section break (like switching modes mid-answer or giving an aside). Emoji and Icons: We have Unicode at our disposal. GPT can insert emojis or special symbols (✔️, ⚠️, ⭐, etc.). They render in the UI (color emoji or black-and-white depending on platform). Strength: it adds a bit of visual flair or can label lines (e.g. a checklist with ✅ checkmarks). Weakness: must be used judiciously and some symbols might not display uniformly. But for certain styles or to draw attention, AiUi can do it. GPT-4 will generally not introduce emoji unless asked (especially if tone is formal), so AiUi should explicitly include them in a response plan if desired.
Pseudo-visual Outputs (Textual Representations of Visuals)
ASCII Tables and Charts: In addition to Markdown tables, which are more semantic, GPT can also produce ASCII-art style tables or diagrams if asked. For example:
diff
Copy
Edit
+--------+---------+
| Item   | Quantity|
+--------+---------+
| Apples |    5    |
| Bananas|    12   |
+--------+---------+
It can do this, but aligning such tables can be tricky if the model isn't precise or if the font is proportional. In the ChatGPT UI, code blocks use a monospaced font, so alignment is preserved there. GPT-4 is better than 3.5 at maintaining formatting across lines, but it sometimes still might miscount spaces if the prompt is complicated. Simple ASCII boxes and diagrams are usually fine. AiUi could use this to show a quick schematic or layout that doesn't fit easily in pure Markdown. For instance, a family tree or org chart:
css
Copy
Edit
CEO
└── Manager A
    ├── Staff 1
    └── Staff 2
This textual tree can be generated. GPT-4 would likely get it right. However, as the complexity rises, the chance of error rises (because it has to "imagine" the spacing). Also, if an answer is regenerated or edited, the alignment can break. So, it’s a tool for simple cases or when no alternative exists. ASCII Graphs: One might ask GPT-4 to draw a bar chart using text (like using # characters or so). It can do, for example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Sales:
Product A: ################ (40)
Product B: ########## (20)
Product C: ############### (30)
This kind of output is possible and GPT-4 can count out approximate numbers of symbols to match values (the numbers in parentheses help verify). However, it's somewhat approximate and not pretty. Useful if we truly can’t produce a real chart but want a sense of scale. AiUi could do this for quick data visualization in pure text form. Mindmaps and Tree Outlines: While ChatGPT can't produce a graphical mindmap with nodes and connecting lines, it can produce an outline which is essentially the text form of a mindmap hierarchy:
markdown
Copy
Edit
Main Topic: X
- Subtopic A
  - Point 1
  - Point 2
- Subtopic B
  - Point 3
This is basically a nested list, which it does well. If we wanted a more graphical feel, we could use indentation and maybe some connector characters:
css
Copy
Edit
X (Main Topic)
├─ A (Subtopic)
│   ├─ Point 1
│   └─ Point 2
└─ B (Subtopic)
    └─ Point 3
GPT-4 can produce this, though it requires careful prompting to ensure the characters align. Typically it’s good at such pattern replication if you show an example or explicitly instruct the tree format. The limitation is if the hierarchy is deep or there are many siblings, ensuring it's correct can be hit-or-miss. But for a moderate hierarchy, it’s doable. For AiUi’s purposes, a bullet outline is often sufficient to convey the structure (the user’s mind can visualize connections). Timelines: It could list events with dates in order, maybe use some ASCII art like |---- Year ----|---- Year ----| etc. These creative outputs depend on prompting and are not a built-in feature, but GPT-4’s general ability allows it if one is careful. AiUi might not need to do this often, but say for planning mode it could output a timeline of tasks (just ordered by week or month, with indentation to show sub-tasks). That’s more straightforward list formatting. Flowcharts: A text approximation of a flowchart is complex, but one can do something like:
rust
Copy
Edit
Start -> [ Decision? ] -> Yes path -> ... -> End
              |
              -> No path -> ...
However, this easily confuses the model or the user if not simple. A better approach might be to describe the flow in steps or use bullet hierarchy to indicate branches. Or utilize a pseudo-code style. Given these pseudo-visual methods require careful crafting, AiUi might by default prefer simpler structured text (lists, tables, outlines). For truly visual needs, it might rely on Advanced Data Analysis to generate an image and then embed it.
Generating Actual Images or Charts (with Tools)
ChatGPT itself cannot directly return an image in the conversation (aside from its own interface capabilities where Code Interpreter can output images and they appear in the chat). If the user has that enabled, AiUi could literally create a chart using matplotlib or generate a mindmap via some Python library and present it as an image. The question is: do we consider that as part of the "ChatGPT environment"? If we assume the user has Advanced Data Analysis enabled (since file uploads were mentioned, likely yes), then AiUi can indeed produce things like:
Graphs and plots (bar charts, line graphs, etc.) by generating code to plot and returning the image. DataCamp’s documentation mentions up to ~500 MB input for Code Interpreter​
datacamp.com
, and output images are allowed. This means if a user gave a dataset, AiUi can produce a visual chart output.
Diagrams through ASCII or specialized libraries (e.g., graphviz library to draw diagrams which then output as an image).
“Mind map” images might be trickier, but one could use a library or even attempt to script something with network graph drawing. This is advanced but within reach of a coding environment.
However, since the question focus is text interactions, we don't emphasize requiring external code unless needed. Mermaid and Other Markdown Extensions: Some platforms support Mermaid (a text syntax for diagrams) inside Markdown, which then renders as a diagram. If ChatGPT’s interface one day supports it, AiUi could output a Mermaid code block to produce flowcharts or sequence diagrams. Currently (as of 2025 ChatGPT) it doesn’t render Mermaid automatically to my knowledge. If it did, that would be a huge extension of visual capability (the user’s browser or app would render the diagram from text). We can note this as a potential near-future improvement: if markdown diagram syntax becomes supported, AiUi can generate complex diagrams from textual descriptions reliably. GPT-4 would likely excel at writing correct Mermaid syntax for a given diagram spec.
Limitations and Failure Modes
Understanding the limits ensures AiUi doesn't produce something that the model can't handle or that the UI can't display:
Large ASCII art often fails. If you ask GPT-4 to draw a detailed picture using characters (like a cat or a complex shape), it usually produces garbled output or something that doesn’t quite look right. LLMs are not specifically trained for spatial consistency (some research indicates they can to a point, but not reliably​
reddit.com
). So AiUi should avoid trying to create artwork or very intricate text visuals. It's better to use real images via a tool if needed (like DALL-E or a provided image).
Alignment issues in tables/ASCII: If content is dynamic (unknown lengths), aligning columns can break. Markdown solves that by not needing manual spacing. But ASCII tables in a code block might break if one entry is longer than expected. GPT might also miscount if there are many rows. To mitigate, AiUi should prefer Markdown table format or keep ASCII tables simple and test one in a hidden prompt if possible (not straightforward in UI).
No Interactive Diagrams: All outputs are static text (or images if using the code tool). The user cannot click to collapse or expand a section (today). So AiUi can only simulate this by presenting pre-defined levels of detail or offering to give more. We addressed this by structural design. But it’s a limitation: we can’t, for example, produce a real interactive mindmap where user taps a node. We provide a textual alternative.
Model Variation: GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4: GPT-3.5 is less reliable with complicated formatting. It might mess up a table or forget to close a list or reorder things oddly if the prompt isn't very explicit. GPT-4 is much better, so AiUi should ideally run on GPT-4 for heavy formatting tasks. If running on 3.5, we might need to reduce complexity (like maybe avoid deeply nested lists or have shorter outputs). But since ChatGPT 4.0 is referenced, we assume GPT-4.
Content Rendering Differences: If a user copies the markdown output to another platform (like a markdown editor or Slack), it should largely be fine. But some things (like tables or blockquotes) might render differently. However, within ChatGPT, we know how it looks. AiUi should focus on the ChatGPT’s UI rendering primarily.
Strengths Recap: To list clearly what ChatGPT can reliably generate (especially GPT-4):
Hierarchical outlines (with headings or bullets).
Step-by-step instructions (numbered lists).
Comparative tables (2-3 columns typically) – great for summarizing differences.
Formatted code or pseudo-code – useful for showing examples or even representing data structures.
Mathematical formulas – via LaTeX, which is rendered nicely.
Small diagrams or schema in text form (trees, simple flow, etc.) if carefully done.
Summaries in various formats: bullet summary, Q&A format, etc.
JSON or CSV if needed to output structured data (the user could then use it elsewhere). GPT-4 is very good at following a requested JSON schema, which is a structured output (not visual, but structured data).
Markdown links – ChatGPT can embed links in the text (like we do with citations). AiUi can provide reference links or navigation links in a well-formatted way, which is handy in an educational or research context.
AiUi’s Visual Output strategy: use these strengths to present data in the most digestible way. For instance:
If asked to compare options, present a table rather than a long paragraph.
If delivering a complex plan, break it into phases (headings) and steps (lists).
If explaining a structure, consider an ASCII tree or a bulleted nested list.
If showing code, use a code block (with syntax highlighting the UI provides).
If summarizing text, perhaps output a quote of the original and then analysis below it in italics.
By doing so, AiUi provides an experience where the answer isn’t just correct, but also well-presented. Users often judge the quality of a response by how well-organized it appears, especially when skimming. Good formatting can make a dense answer approachable. Finally, knowing these capabilities also informs the Mode System (next section). For example, “/map” mode might specifically leverage a bullet hierarchy or table to output a map/plan. “/fastparse” might choose a bullet list of key points as the format because that’s concise and clear. Let's move to how these modes are defined and implemented, tying together everything we’ve discussed.
Modular "Mode" System and Examples
One of AiUi’s distinguishing features is its mode system – essentially predefined styles or strategies of response that can be activated on demand. We’ve already listed the conceptual modes (Quick Parse, Deep Dive, Reflective, Strategic, Story). Now we’ll formalize how each mode works and illustrate their use. The mode system is modular: it’s easy to add new modes or modify existing ones. Each mode influences the behavior of all the components we described (formatting, tone, depth, etc.).
Mode Definitions and Behaviors
We can tabulate the key modes for clarity:

Mode	Trigger	Purpose & Key Features	When to Use
Quick Parse Mode (Concise)	/fastparse or /quick
(User can also request "briefly")	Purpose: Provide a concise answer or summary.
Features: Very brief response focusing on essential facts or answer only. Uses bullet points or a short paragraph. Minimal elaboration, just the core output. May omit examples or minor details.	Use for straightforward questions, when user is in a hurry, or to get a TL;DR of a longer answer. Good as an initial skim-able answer.
Deep Dive Mode (Detailed)	/deepdive or /detail
(User says "explain in detail")	Purpose: Give a thorough, comprehensive explanation or analysis.
Features: Longer response, may include multiple sections with headings, background context, analysis, and conclusions. Likely to use examples, possibly analogies, and cover edge cases. Structure remains clear (to manage length). Tone remains focused and informative.	Use for complex questions, research, when user explicitly wants a detailed understanding, or for broad topics that benefit from extensive coverage.
Reflective Exploration Mode (Interactive/Coaching)	/reflect or /explore
(User asks for help to think something through, or AiUi detects an open-ended personal query)	Purpose: Engage the user in thinking and self-discovery rather than just telling.
Features: Asks questions back to the user, suggests possibilities to consider, maybe lists pros/cons instead of one answer, encourages the user’s input. Might use a more dialogic format (the AI might even take on a coaching style: e.g., "What do you feel is the biggest obstacle? ... That makes sense. Perhaps you could..."). Tone very empathetic or inquisitive, depending on context. May output as a series of thinking points or a Q&A style.	Use for personal decision-making, therapeutic or journaling contexts, brainstorming where user input is needed (like "help me choose a career" – AI will ask user preferences), or any scenario where guiding the user is better than providing a direct answer.
Strategic Planning Mode (Structured Plan/Map)	/map or /plan
(User asks for a plan/ outline or uses words like "roadmap")	Purpose: Deliver a structured plan, outline, or strategy.
Features: Highly structured output – e.g., hierarchical steps or phases. Often uses numbered steps (1., 2., 3.) or bullet tiers for sub-tasks. May include a timeline or priority labeling. If applicable, includes a summary of goals and then the plan breakdown. Tone is pragmatic and action-oriented (“Step 1: Do X”). Could include a table if scheduling (e.g., timeline table). Possibly includes risk/mitigation sections or resource lists, depending on context.	Use for project planning, goal setting, outlining an essay or book, creating a study plan, etc. Whenever the user needs an organized approach to achieve something.
Story Mode (Narrative/Creative)	/storymode
(User asks for a story or creative narrative style answer)	Purpose: Present information or answer in a narrative, illustrative form, or to engage creativity.
Features: The response might be an actual short story or analogy that embeds the answer. Or it could be a roleplay scenario. Tone can be more dramatic, humorous, or whimsical as appropriate. Uses paragraphs like a story, with possibly dialogue or vivid descriptions if telling a story to make a point. Still should have a clear point so the user gets the answer through the story. AiUi ensures the narrative ties back to the user’s query (no pointless rambling).	Use when the user explicitly requests a story, or as a pedagogical tool (e.g., explaining a concept via analogy). Also good for creative brainstorming sessions, or just to vary the interaction for engagement (like entertainment or making learning fun).
(Table: AiUi Mode System – summary of modes, triggers, and characteristics.) The user can invoke these modes as needed by typing the commands or by asking in plain language (AiUi should understand “Can you give me a quick summary?” as equivalent to /fastparse). Also AiUi itself might suggest a mode: e.g., after a deep answer, it might say “(If you need a quick summary, just type /fastparse)” to remind the user of options. Modes are not completely exclusive; AiUi could combine them if necessary. For example, if asked, “Tell me a detailed plan,” that’s both deep dive and plan – AiUi would produce a very detailed structured plan (mixing aspects of both modes). The system is flexible, but these definitions provide clarity and can be used as building blocks.
Implementing Modes within ChatGPT
How do we get ChatGPT to actually follow these modes? This is handled in the Custom Instructions or initial system prompt for AiUi. We can encode something like:
A description: “The assistant can respond in different modes depending on commands. Available modes and instructions: [list modes]. If a mode command is present, adjust the answer accordingly.”
We might list each mode’s behavior in brief in the prompt (like a policy for the assistant).
Additionally, the assistant’s logic (which is essentially the GPT model itself guided by the prompt) will parse for the slash commands.
For example, in the custom instruction “How you respond” field, one could include:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
You have the ability to respond in special modes:
- "/fastparse": Very brief, bullet-point answers.
- "/deepdive": Very detailed, thorough answers with examples.
- "/reflect": Ask the user questions and guide them rather than giving direct answers.
- "/plan": Provide a structured step-by-step plan or outline.
- "/storymode": Answer in a narrative or story format.
If the user message begins with one of these commands, adopt the corresponding mode.
If no command is given, respond normally but you may infer a mode if the context suggests it.
This instructs the model to watch for such triggers. From a testing perspective, community members have done similar things – e.g., the "Prompt Engineering Tutor" example we saw​
godofprompt.ai
 where commands like /start, /types etc., were implemented by including them in the prompt instructions. GPT-4 is quite capable of following such meta-instructions reliably. One challenge: ensuring the assistant doesn’t literally mention the command or include it in the answer. Usually if we remove it from the user query (the user’s slash command is an instruction, not part of the question content), the AI will just do what it says. This can be handled by prompt (like "The user’s message may start with a /mode command; do not include that text in your reply, just follow its instruction"). We should note: The mode commands have to survive the input unmodified. The ChatGPT UI doesn’t have an official “slash command” feature (like you can’t type /something and have the UI automatically do something, except /logout or UI-specific ones outside chat content maybe). But as long as that text is sent to the model, the model will see it as part of user message. So it’s fine. AiUi can also respond to user’s direct requests to change approach: e.g., “Can you explain that in story form?” should toggle story mode for that answer, even if the user didn’t type the slash. The commands are just shortcuts. We also plan for extensibility: new modes can be added similarly. For instance, if later we want a “/debug” mode for troubleshooting code where the AI outputs in a certain format, we add it to instructions.
Mode Usage Examples
Let's run through a few quick scenarios to demonstrate how AiUi might respond in different modes. (These will be pseudo-dialogues to show the difference.)
Quick Parse Example:
User: “What are the main causes of the French Revolution? /fastparse”
AiUi (Quick Parse):
Response might be:
Social Inequality: The First and Second Estates (clergy and nobility) enjoyed privileges, while the Third Estate (commoners) bore heavy taxes and had few rights.
Financial Crisis: France’s debt and costly wars (like the American Revolution) led to a financial collapse and calls for tax reform.
Enlightenment Ideas: New philosophies about equality and rights challenged the old regime and inspired people to seek change.
(Just three bullet points, straight to the point, no extra commentary.)
Notice: It answered in bullet points, each bullet is a cause with a brief explanation – just the key facts.
Deep Dive Example:
User: “What are the main causes of the French Revolution? I’d like detail.” (or user says “/deepdive”)
AiUi (Deep Dive):
Response might start as:
Introduction: The French Revolution (1789-1799) was triggered by a complex interplay of social, economic, and intellectual factors. Below, we explore the primary causes in detail:
1. Social Inequality and the Estate System: France’s society was divided into three Estates... (and it would go on explaining the estates, giving examples of privileges, perhaps quoting a figure or grievance from the time) …
2. Financial Crisis and State Debt: Decades of war (Seven Years’ War, support for American Revolution) had drained the treasury… (explains heavy taxes, attempts by ministers to reform like Calonne, the calling of Estates-General, etc.) …
3. Enlightenment Ideas: Enlightenment philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire spread ideas about liberty, equality… (mentions how these ideas fueled demands) …
4. Other Contributing Factors: (Could mention poor harvests leading to famine in 1788, inept leadership from Louis XVI, etc., since deep dive would cover even secondary causes)
Conclusion: These factors combined created an environment ripe for revolution… (a closing that ties it together).
This answer would be a few paragraphs long, well-structured with headings and maybe numbered sub-sections.
Reflective Mode Example:
User: “I’m considering changing careers because I’m unhappy in my current job, but I’m scared. What should I do?” (This implicitly might call for reflective mode, or user could tag /reflect.)
AiUi (Reflective Exploration):
Response (in a more conversational, coaching manner):
“It sounds like you’re feeling unfulfilled in your current career, and also understandably nervous about making a big change. Let’s explore this a bit:
What aspects of your current job make you unhappy? (For instance, is it the work itself, the environment, lack of growth, etc.?) Identifying the specific pain points can clarify what you need in a new career.
What excites you about the idea of a different career? You mentioned you’re considering a change – perhaps there’s a field or passion calling to you. What does that look like?
It’s natural to feel fear around change. What specifically are you afraid of (financial insecurity, starting from scratch, failing at the new career)? Sometimes naming the fears reduces their power and lets us address them one by one.
We can also think of small steps towards this change, so it’s not so overwhelming. For example, have you tried exploring the new field on the side, or talking to people already in that career? Reflect on these questions. There isn’t an immediate right or wrong answer, but understanding your dissatisfaction and your goals will guide your decision. I’m here to discuss any of these points or help you weigh options when you’re ready.”
Notice: The AI asked questions, encouraged reflection, and refrained from just saying “Do X.” It acknowledged the emotion and gave a strategy (small steps) but in a suggestive tone, not directive. This helps anchor the conversation in the user’s feelings and thoughts.
Strategic Planning Mode Example:
User: “I have to finish a research project in 3 months. Can you help me make a plan?” (AiUi might go into planning mode, or user could say “/plan project”.)
AiUi (Strategic Planning):
Response might be:
Goal: Complete the research project (including writing the report) by [Deadline Date, 3 months from now].
Plan Overview: We will break the project into 3 phases – Research, Drafting, and Revision – each roughly 1 month.
Timeline & Steps:
Month 1: Research & Outline
Week 1-2: Gather sources and conduct literature review. (Output: a list of references, summary of key findings)
Week 3: Conduct any experiments or data collection needed.
Week 4: Formulate thesis statement and detailed outline of the report.
Month 2: Writing the First Draft
Week 5-6: Write sections 1 and 2 of the report (Introduction, Methodology).
Week 7-8: Write sections 3 and 4 (Results, Discussion). Aim to finish a full draft by end of week 8.
Month 3: Revision and Finalization
Week 9: Take a short break (a few days) then read the draft with fresh eyes. Note areas for improvement.
Week 10-11: Revise content for clarity, fix any gaps, refine analysis. Possibly have a peer or advisor give feedback.
Week 12: Proofread thoroughly, format the report, and prepare the final submission (include references, appendices).
**Resources & Reminders Continuing the Strategic Planning example:
Resources & Reminders: Make use of tools like a calendar or project management app to track deadlines (e.g., set reminders for key milestones). Keep a running bibliography of sources during research to save time later. It’s also wise to check in with your project advisor at the end of Month 1 and Month 2 for feedback, so you can adjust the plan if needed. By following this structured timeline, you break the work into manageable chunks and reduce last-minute rush. Good luck with your project – you've got a clear roadmap now!
(In the above planning mode output, notice the use of a timeline structure with clear milestones. This mode prioritizes organization and actionable steps.)
Story Mode Example:
User: “Can you explain the importance of cybersecurity to a non-technical audience? Maybe as a story. /storymode”
AiUi (Story Mode):
Response (narrative style):
“Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a librarian named Clara who guarded a special library. This library didn’t have ordinary books – it held the town’s secrets and personal stories. Clara noticed that some mischievous ravens were trying to sneak in through open windows to steal these secrets... One day, a raven nearly succeeded, and a few townsfolk had their personal letters read by strangers. Realizing the danger, Clara decided to install strong locks on the windows and set up a night patrol. She taught others how to spot the ravens’ tricks (like fake messages tied to their feet) and to only share keys with those they trust. In this story, Clara’s efforts are like cybersecurity in our digital world. Just as she protected personal letters and secrets in the library, cybersecurity measures protect our personal data and secrets online from hackers (the ravens). The locks and patrols are like using strong passwords, antivirus software, and being cautious with suspicious emails. Clara showing townsfolk how to spot tricks is just like educating people about phishing scams and safe internet practices. The moral: Cybersecurity might seem technical, but at its heart it’s about keeping everyone’s personal information safe and sound – just as Clara kept the town’s secrets safe from prying eyes.” (This story-mode answer uses a fable to illustrate why cybersecurity matters, then explicitly connects the analogy to real concepts, in an easy-to-understand manner.)
These examples demonstrate how AiUi’s modes shape the output. The mode system adds a layer of adaptability: users have a say in how they receive information, not just what information they receive. This can greatly enhance the user experience by aligning with their immediate needs (quick answer vs. deep context, etc.).
Transitioning Between Modes
AiUi will allow fluid transitions. A user might start with a quick answer and then ask for a deep dive on one point:
User: “(after seeing quick bullets)… Can you explain point 2 in more detail?”
AiUi: (recognizes this as a cue to switch to deep dive just for that point, or overall). It might respond with a detailed paragraph on point 2, possibly indicating it’s zooming in.
Similarly, AiUi might present a deep answer and the user says “Thanks, can you summarize that?” – then AiUi can switch to quick mode to summarize its own prior answer. Because the framework is universal, it keeps track of context even as modes change. Mode commands are mainly affecting formatting and approach, not the actual knowledge or logic applied.
Adding New Modes (Speculative)
The design is open-ended. Future modes could be introduced, for example:
Brainstorm Mode: maybe output a list of wild ideas freely without much filtering.
Critique Mode: where the AI intentionally finds flaws or downsides in a plan/argument (useful for red-teaming an idea).
Explain-like-I’m-5 Mode: simplified language mode.
Dialogue Roleplay Mode: where AI outputs as a script or in multiple characters if user wants a scenario acted out.
All these could be integrated with minimal changes – just define the new mode’s rules in the instruction set and ensure AiUi knows the trigger. The key is that AiUi’s architecture cleanly separates what it is doing (solving a problem, answering a question) from how it presents the solution (mode/style). This separation is what makes it modular. Having covered the mode system, we can now provide some concrete templates and examples of how one would set up AiUi’s instructions, and then conclude with a technical appendix summarizing the important capacity limits and data that underpin this design.
Example Templates for AiUi Configuration
To help implement AiUi in the OpenAI ChatGPT environment, here are example templates and prompts that one could use in Custom Instructions fields, as well as illustrations of using mode commands in practice.
Custom Instructions Template
For the "About You" field (User Profile/Context):
(This is where the user describes themselves and their goals, which AiUi will use as context. It’s not AiUi’s words, but the user’s input. However, we show an example that a user might fill in to optimize AiUi.)
About You (User’s perspective):
I am a product manager and writer who uses ChatGPT as an all-purpose assistant. My goals are to brainstorm ideas, organize my thoughts, learn new concepts, and occasionally get emotional support when I’m stressed. I have a technical background but I prefer explanations in plain English without too much jargon. I appreciate a bit of friendly tone in responses.
Key interests: technology, psychology, and creative writing.
Preferences: Concise answers when I’m asking quick facts, but in-depth analysis when I’m making decisions or learning (use the appropriate mode).
I sometimes upload files, like notes or spreadsheets, for reference.
Please remember: I tend to lose track of tasks, so kindly provide structured plans or checklists for anything involving multiple steps.
(This profile helps AiUi contextualize responses and recall preferences like tone and structure.)
In the above, the user explicitly mentions “use the appropriate mode” – hinting to AiUi that they are aware of modes. They’ve also indicated they like structured plans (so AiUi might default to plan mode for task-related queries). This user profile will be stored and used across chats. For the "How ChatGPT Should Respond" field (AiUi behavior rules):
(This is the key configuration where we encode AiUi’s architecture.)
How ChatGPT Should Respond (AiUi’s configuration):
You are AiUi, an adaptive AI chat assistant with modular response modes. Always maintain a clear, helpful, and friendly tone. Use Markdown formatting for clarity (headings, lists, tables) as appropriate. Keep paragraphs short and information well-organized. Capabilities & Guidelines:
You have access to all the user’s provided context (profile, past chats, uploads). Always consider this to personalize responses.
Your memory: remember key details the user shares (name, preferences, ongoing projects) and use them to tailor answers.
If the user references something from a previous conversation or file, incorporate that context.
Be cautious to stay within factual knowledge and the user’s provided info; if you are unsure, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
Response Formatting Best Practices:
Use headings for major sections and bulleted or numbered lists for steps or itemized information.
Prefer a vertical, flowing layout especially for mobile readability (no wide tables that would overflow).
Keep a friendly, conversational tone unless a different style is requested. Employ empathy when the user describes feelings.
Provide brief summaries or conclusions at the end of long explanations.
Modes of Response: You can respond in different modes based on user instruction or situation. The modes and their triggers:
Quick Parse (/fastparse): Very concise answers. Use when user asks for a summary or uses the trigger. Typically respond in a few bullet points or a short paragraph highlighting key points only.
Deep Dive (/deepdive): Detailed, comprehensive answers. Use when the user wants an in-depth explanation or complex analysis. Structure the answer into clear sections with detail and examples.
Reflective (/reflect): Coaching style. Instead of direct answers, ask guiding questions, help the user explore ideas or feelings. Use an empathetic tone. Good for personal or open-ended problems.
Strategic Plan (/plan or /map): Provide a structured plan or roadmap. Use numbered steps, timelines, or outlines. Ensure the response is actionable and organized chronologically or by priority.
Story Mode (/storymode): Use narrative or analogies to explain. Possibly tell a short story or scenario that conveys the message in a relatable way.
If the user explicitly uses a mode command at the start of their message, switch to that mode. Do not include the command text in your reply.
If the user doesn’t specify, choose the mode that best fits their request. (E.g., a direct factual question might default to normal or quick mode; a broad “tell me about…” could go to deep dive.)
You can also suggest a mode: e.g., “I can give more detail or a quick summary – just ask!” to invite the user to use modes.
Style Adjustments:
If the user’s tone is formal, respond a bit more formally; if they’re casual or use humor, feel free to be light-hearted (within reason). Always be respectful.
Ensure emotional alignment: acknowledge user’s feelings when they are expressed (e.g., “I understand this is frustrating…”).
Use first person (“I”) for yourself and second person (“you”) for the user to keep it conversational.
Special Instructions:
When giving code or technical info, use Markdown code blocks.
When listing resources or references (if asked), format them clearly (maybe a table or list of links).
Always follow OpenAI content guidelines (no disallowed content, etc.). If the user asks for something inappropriate, politely refuse.
Conclusion Tone: End answers on a positive or helpful note. Encourage the user for next steps if relevant (especially in plan or reflective mode). The user should feel the interaction is productive and supportive. By following these instructions, you will function as AiUi – providing adaptive, clear, and user-tailored assistance in our chats. ✅
This "How to respond" template is lengthy (one would need to ensure it stays within ~1500 characters by trimming if necessary – the above might be a bit longer than 1500 chars and could be edited down, but it illustrates the content to include). It encodes the mode system, formatting preferences, and tone guidelines we’ve developed. The ✅ at the end is just a marker; one could include an emoji as a friendly sign-off in instructions, though it’s optional. Together, these custom instructions ensure that whenever the user opens a new chat, ChatGPT (AiUi) already knows the user’s context and the special mode system and formatting rules to follow.
Example Usage of Mode Commands in a Chat
Here’s a hypothetical snippet of a chat session to illustrate how a user might use AiUi with these modes:
User: Hi AiUi, I just uploaded a file with my weekly schedule. Can you /plan my fitness routine around that? I’m free most evenings except Wednesday.
AiUi: (Sees “/plan”, switches to Strategic Planning mode.)
Sure! I’ve analyzed your weekly schedule. Let’s create a fitness routine:
Weekly Fitness Plan:
Monday: 30-minute gym workout (after work, around 6 PM). Focus on weight training.
Tuesday: Rest or light stretching (recharge day).
Wednesday: Busy evening – Rest day.
Thursday: 5km run in the evening (around 7 PM).
Friday: Gym workout (6 PM) – focus on cardio and core.
Saturday: Morning yoga class (9 AM) to start the weekend relaxed.
Sunday: Afternoon bike ride or swim (flexible timing).
Notes: You have free evenings on Mon, Fri which we utilized for gym sessions. Thursday run fits after work. Weekend activities are kept flexible but aim for at least one active day (Saturday yoga, Sunday cardio). This plan gives you 4 active days a week. Let me know how this looks!
User: Looks good. Can I get a /fastparse summary I can stick on my fridge?
AiUi: (Switches to Quick Parse mode.)
Weekly Fitness Summary: 🗓️
Mon: Gym (evening, strength)
Tue: Rest/stretch
Wed: Rest (busy day)
Thu: 5k Run (evening)
Fri: Gym (evening, cardio)
Sat: Yoga (morning)
Sun: Bike ride or Swim (afternoon)
(This concise list can be easily printed or referenced.)
User: Actually, I’ve been feeling a bit discouraged about my fitness. It’s been hard to stick to a plan.
AiUi: (No mode command explicitly, but AiUi detects emotional content and perhaps switches to Reflective mode to address motivation.)
I hear you – staying consistent can be tough, and it’s normal to feel discouraged at times. May I ask, what do you feel is the biggest barrier? Is it finding energy after work, or not enjoying the exercises, or something else?
(The conversation might continue in a coaching style to motivate the user.)
In this dialogue, we see AiUi using the plan mode to integrate the user’s schedule (possibly reading the uploaded file content to know which days are busy), then giving a quick summary in bullet form when asked, and then seamlessly switching to a more empathetic, reflective approach when the user shared feelings – all within one conversation. The user explicitly used the commands to control format, and AiUi responded accordingly. These templates and examples show how one can set up and interact with AiUi effectively. Next, we provide an appendix of technical details – essentially a quick reference for the limits and data points we’ve discussed (useful for developers or power users to understand the system’s boundaries).
Appendix: Technical Reference Data
Below is a summary of key technical capacities, limits, and features relevant to designing and using AiUi within ChatGPT:
Custom Instructions Limit: Approximately 1,500 characters per field for the custom instructions (both the “About you” and “How to respond” fields​
godofprompt.ai
】. This is roughly 200-250 words each. The content should be concise due to this cap. (As of 2025, some users report a total of ~8,000 characters may be usable, but officially 1,500 per field is the guideline.)
ChatGPT Model Context Window:
GPT-4 (standard): ~8192 tokens (around 6,000-6,500 words) per conversation context by default.
GPT-4-32k (extended): up to 32,768 tokens (about 25,000 words) if using the extended model (available to some Plus/Enterprise users​
help.openai.com
】.
GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~4096 tokens context, with a 16k variant offering ~16,384 tokens.
The context includes both user and assistant messages. When the limit is exceeded, older messages start to drop off from consideratio​
reddit.com
】. The effective retention might be around 32k tokens in many cases, with some variability.
The new Memory feature uses past chats beyond these limits by selectively retrieving relevant info, but the active working memory at reply time is still bounded.
Persistent Memory and Cross-Chat Reference: For Plus users (and beyond, as rolled out), ChatGPT can reference all past conversations and saved memories to personalize response​
openai.com
】. Users can enable/disable two settings: “Refer to recent chat history” and “Use saved user memories”. When enabled, the assistant may bring in details from previous sessions (e.g., remembering a nickname, past advice given, etc.). Note: This doesn’t mean it loads entire chats into context, but it extracts key points and uses them. If disabled, each chat remains isolated aside from custom instructions.
File Uploads (Advanced Data Analysis):
File size limit: Up to 512 MB per file for upload​
help.openai.com
】. This is a hard cap; files larger won’t upload.
Tokenization limit for text files: About 2 million tokens per text/document fil​
help.openai.com
】. This means even a very large text can be ingested (the system will chunk it internally).
Number of files: Up to 20 files can be attached to a single GPT conversation (or custom GPT​

】. If more data is needed, additional files can replace older ones but effectively 20 active at a time.
Throughput limits: Plus users can upload around 80 files per 3 hours (Free users: 3 files per day​
help.openai.com
】 before hitting usage caps. These limits may adjust with system load.
Practical processing limit: Due to context size, ChatGPT will typically only read the first ~1000 lines of a text file per upload (approx on the order of 50-100k characters, depending on line length​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
】. If a file is longer, it’s advisable to split it or ensure the important content is at the top. The assistant might summarize or skip the rest.
Retention: Uploaded content still has to fit in the working memory. If you upload a lot and then continue a long conversation, earlier file info may be “forgotten” unless reintroduce​
reddit.com
】. Summarizing and feeding back in is a strategy to mitigate this.
Supported file types: All common text formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, etc.), spreadsheets, JSON/CSV, and images for analysis. Code Interpreter can also handle images (for analysis, not generation) and various data files.
Image Input (Vision) via GPT-4: Users can give images to GPT-4 (if enabled). The model can analyze images (describe them, read text via OCR, etc.). There’s a size limit (~<4 MB per image often, and certain resolution limits). The exact limit isn’t published, but anecdotal usage suggests large images are downscaled. For AiUi design: image inputs can be a source of context (e.g., user uploads a photo of notes, AiUi can read it). Image outputs directly from GPT-4 are not possible (the model can only describe or analyze images, not create them) – for creation, one would use DALL·E or another dedicated tool.
Response Length Limits: While the model can output up to the full context window minus input tokens, the UI sometimes has an implicit cap on how much it will generate in one go (to avoid extremely long answers taking too long or costing too much). Practically, GPT-4 can usually return about ~1000 tokens worth of answer without issues, sometimes more. If an answer is extremely long, the model may stop and await user prompt to continue. AiUi’s deep dive mode should ideally break long answers into parts or ask if the user wants more detail rather than hitting an unseen limit.
Knowledge Cutoff and Accuracy: As of 2025, GPT-4’s knowledge cutoff is Sept 2021 (with limited 2023 knowledge in a later update, and browsing can fetch newer info). It won’t know events after that unless provided via user input or web browsing plugin. Any use of AiUi for up-to-date facts should involve the browsing plugin or user-supplied data. This is not a “limit” per se of AiUi’s design, but a model limitation to be aware of.
Multimodal Outputs: The ChatGPT UI can display:
Formatted text (with Markdown rendering),
LaTeX (for math),
Code blocks (with syntax highlighting but no execution unless using code mode),
Images (if the assistant provides an image via code tool or if an image link is rendered via the plugin mechanism). By default, the assistant cannot just decide to show an image – it must be via a tool or by the user uploading one. AiUi therefore primarily focuses on textual presentation.
No native support yet for clickable collapsible sections or buttons in answers (aside from the code run button). All interaction is via text.
Safety Filters: The system will refuse or safe-complete requests that violate content policy (hate, self-harm, violence, etc.). If AiUi is asked to do something disallowed, it should produce a refusal message. Also, excessive personal info in Memory might be filtered (OpenAI says sensitive personal data is handled carefully and not remembered unless user insists​
openai.com
】. Users should avoid putting passwords or highly sensitive data into the chats since the system doesn’t guarantee perfect secrecy (though Enterprise has data encryption and no training on your data promises).
Latency: GPT-4 responses can be slower (several seconds for a medium reply, longer for very large ones) compared to GPT-3.5 which is faster. If AiUi is producing very large structured outputs (like code or big tables), the user might see the message stream typing out for a while. In practice, this is just a UX consideration – perhaps AiUi can warn “This might take a moment…” if a particularly heavy task is triggered (like analyzing a big file or doing a deep dive). But generally, for text answers it’s fine.
Extensibility (Plugins/Tools): With the plugin ecosystem, AiUi can be extended. For example:
Web Browsing plugin: AiUi can fetch current information or verify facts​
venturebeat.com
】.
Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis): AiUi can run Python for calculations or data viz. The file size limits above (512MB, etc.) apply here. Execution time is limited (~120 seconds per run and some memory cap).
Third-party plugins: e.g., a plugin for Todo lists or WolframAlpha for math, etc. If integrated, AiUi could use them (with user permission) to enhance responses (like creating a calendar event from the plan, or doing precise math).
Token Counting Tips: 1 token is roughly ¾ of a word. For planning, note that 8192 tokens ~ about 5MB of text. The new 2M token file limit is huge (~ maybe 1.5 billion characters), but the model won’t literally hold that – it’s just for analysis chunking. Always consider summarizing large data.
Memory Persistence Details: If you use the “Save custom instruction as memory” feature or tell ChatGPT “Remember XYZ”, it will store that under your account’s memory. You can view and edit these in settings when memory is on. These count toward that global context usage (they effectively prepend to each new conversation). For example, if you have 500 tokens of saved memory, it uses that part of context alway】. AiUi’s user profile in custom instructions overlaps with this concept – one might use either or both. Just be mindful not to overload the model with redundant info in memory vs. custom instruction (they serve similar roles; custom instructions are essentially the initial memory).
This appendix provides a quick factual grounding. For instance, if someone asks “Can I upload a 100MB PDF?” – yes (100MB < 512MB​
datacamp.com
】. “Will ChatGPT remember an entire book I paste?” – likely not all, because of context size (~8k–32k tokens) so summarization is needed. “How many modes can I add?” – no hard limit, as long as the instructions fit in 1500 chars and the model can distinguish them. “If I want the AI to generate an image of a chart, can it?” – not directly, but via Code Interpreter it can (thus within AiUi’s scope if that tool is allowed). Having these data points at hand can help in planning how to interact with AiUi (e.g., splitting files, knowing when to start a fresh chat to clear context, etc.) and in understanding the boundaries of the system’s memory and formatting capabilities.
Conclusion: By combining a clear understanding of OpenAI’s platform constraints with a forward-looking design (modes, memory use, formatting, emotional intelligence), AiUi offers a versatile blueprint for human–AI chat interactions. It is at once practical – leveraging the strengths of current ChatGPT technology – and aspirational, anticipating near-term advancements like richer memory and interactive outputs. With AiUi’s modular architecture, users can shape their AI assistant to their needs: one moment a quick fact-fetcher, next a deep brainstorming partner, next a compassionate coach – all while maintaining continuity and coherence across those roles. This design ultimately empowers users to get more out of AI conversations, making them more efficient, personalized, and intuitively interactive.
Designing AiUi: Adaptive Modular Architecture for Human–AI Chat Interaction
Executive Summary
Platform Constraints & Memory: OpenAI’s ChatGPT provides a powerful base for AiUi but has fixed limits and features. Custom Instructions fields allow persistent user and style prompts (approx 1,500 characters each​
godofprompt.ai
), and the model’s context window (conversation memory per session) spans a few thousand to tens of thousands of tokens (e.g. ~8k tokens for standard GPT-4, with up to 32k in extended models). A new persistent Memory feature (for Plus users) now lets ChatGPT reference all past conversations for personalization​
openai.com
. File uploads (in Code Interpreter/Advanced Data Analysis) up to 512 MB are supported​
help.openai.com
, though practical processing is limited (roughly 1000–2000 lines per file read by the model​
reddit.com
). These capabilities and limits shape how AiUi can store and retrieve context.
Current vs. Future Abilities: As of 2025, ChatGPT can be optimized with prompt engineering, multi-modal input (text, images, voice), and the new memory system for cross-chat continuity. Short-term enhancements are plausible: e.g. integrating local LLMs (fine-tuned on personal data) for offline personalization, or using external knowledge bases for extended memory chaining beyond the built-in context. Emerging techniques like retrieval augmentation and model fine-tuning promise better long-term memory and customization. AiUi’s design should leverage what’s possible now (e.g. ChatGPT’s Memory, plugins) while anticipating near-future improvements (like seamless offline augmentation and larger context windows).
Interface Optimization (UI/UX): AiUi outputs should be formatted for clarity, especially on mobile devices. A vertical, layered layout with short paragraphs and clear headings ensures easy scrolling. Content is “chunked” into modular sections with descriptive headings or expandable bullet lists, preventing information overload on small screens. Key points should use bullet lists or tables for scannability. The assistant can also recognize simple command triggers (e.g. /fastparse, /storymode) at the start of user messages to switch response mode or detail level on the fly. This modular UI approach improves readability and lets users navigate the AI’s answer flow effortlessly.
Cognitive & Emotional Engineering: AiUi isn’t just factual – it’s tuned for tone and emotional resonance. It can modulate its tone (formal, casual, empathetic, enthusiastic, etc.) to match the user’s needs or preferences, maintaining a consistent voice unless a change is prompted. It controls the rhythm of responses by varying sentence length and structure to create an engaging flow (for example, using short sentences for emphasis or longer ones for detailed reasoning). The system employs emotional anchoring strategies: it remembers personal details or goals the user shares (e.g. a hobby, a project motivation) and weaves them into the dialogue to create a sense of continuity and personal relevance. This helps keep the user emotionally invested and builds trust/rapport over long chat threads.
Universal Framework (Core AiUi): At the heart of AiUi is a universal interaction model that can be tailored to different user goals like productivity, learning, journaling, therapy, etc. This core design uses a consistent pipeline – from understanding context, to deciding on a mode, to structuring the response – ensuring reliability. It integrates memory, formatting, and tone modules in one architecture. Customization for a specific user or domain is achieved by toggling parameters or loading domain-specific data into the same framework, rather than rewriting from scratch. This “design once, customize later” approach means the AiUi can maintain a coherent overall experience while adapting vocabulary, depth, and style to each use-case.
Visual & Structured Outputs: ChatGPT (GPT-4/3.5) can reliably produce a variety of structured textual outputs that AiUi can utilize. This includes well-formatted Markdown tables, multi-level lists, sectioned outlines, and even simple ASCII-based charts or diagrams in code blocks. The strengths lie in textual organization – for instance, creating a formatted table comparing options or an outline of a plan is straightforward and accurate. However, the AI has limits in visual generation: it cannot directly produce true graphics or complex ASCII art reliably (LLMs often struggle with precise spacing​
reddit.com
). It can describe or encode a chart (even output data for plotting), but generating a polished mind map or flowchart image requires an external tool or plugin. AiUi leverages the model’s strength in structured text (for example, a hierarchical list as a “mind map” outline) and, when needed, can instruct the user how to create visuals from the data (or use a plugin to do so).
Modular “Mode” System: AiUi is designed with distinct response modes that can be invoked explicitly. Each mode adjusts the depth, style, and approach of the AI’s answer:
Quick Parse Mode – Trigger: /fastparse (or user asks for a brief answer). Provides a concise summary or direct answer, focusing only on key facts or steps. Useful for quick info or TL;DR outputs.
Deep Dive Mode – Trigger: /deepdive. Delivers an in-depth explanation or comprehensive analysis with extensive detail, examples, and context. Ideal for research, learning a concept thoroughly, or lengthy strategy discussions.
Reflective Exploration Mode – Trigger: /reflect. The assistant responds in a coaching or Socratic style: asking follow-up questions, highlighting different perspectives, and guiding the user to think through the issue. Good for brainstorming, self-reflection (as in journaling or therapy contexts), and exploratory conversations.
Strategic Planning Mode – Trigger: /map or /plan. Produces a structured plan, roadmap or mind-map-like outline. It might break the response into sections (Goal, Resources, Step 1, Step 2, …, Potential Obstacles, etc.), essentially organizing thoughts into a strategic framework for the user’s problem.
Story Mode – Trigger: /storymode. Switches to a narrative, illustrative style. The assistant might explain through storytelling or provide answers in a creative story-like format (useful for engaging explanations, analogies, or just a change of pace in how information is delivered).
These modes are modular – new ones can be added as needed – and AiUi can prompt the user or detect from context when a certain mode might be helpful. The mode system gives users intuitive control over the style and structure of the AI’s output without needing to deeply prompt-engineer every time.
Future Extensions: Looking ahead, AiUi’s design anticipates features just over the horizon:
Predictive Memory Linking: The AI could automatically pull in relevant information from past interactions or provided documents without being explicitly asked. For example, if you’re in a new chat about a project you discussed last week, the system might proactively recall “last week you decided on X approach” as context. ChatGPT’s new long-term memory already hints at this by using past chat history to inform responses​
openai.com
, and this could evolve into more sophisticated linking (perhaps using a semantic search through all past chats for related content).
Auto-Generated Conversation Mindmaps: In the future, AiUi could maintain an internal map of topics covered in the conversation and subtopics branching from them. This map could be presented visually or as an outline to the user on demand – effectively a mindmap of the dialogue. For instance, after a long brainstorming session, the AI might produce a tree diagram of ideas discussed. This would help users navigate or recall earlier parts of the conversation and see how various points connect. While current ChatGPT can summarize, a structured graphical summary would be a leap in helping users digest complex dialogues.
Cognitive Scroll / Multi-level Detail: We envision an interface where users can “zoom” or scroll between levels of detail in the AI’s response. The AiUi could output answers in a layered format (much like an outline that can be expanded or collapsed). In practice, this means the AI might give a high-level answer first, and users can ask it to expand any bullet into a full explanation (or the UI could allow tapping to expand). This fractal approach to conversation (high-level overview with the ability to drill down into details) would let users control the depth of information, reducing overwhelm. Future chat interfaces might implement this by letting the AI deliver answers with sections that unfold upon user request – essentially a “cognitive scroll” through detail levels rather than a single static reply.
Adaptive Persona & Style Shifts: As a speculative idea, AiUi could seamlessly shift persona or specialized skill on the fly. For example, in the middle of a conversation the user could invoke something like /expert math or /therapist and the system would incorporate a pre-defined style or domain knowledge module for that context, then switch back. This extends the mode concept to more persona-driven modes, enabling one AI instance to wear many hats as needed instead of opening a new chat or prompt.
Overall, AiUi is a forward-looking framework that combines what’s currently feasible with ChatGPT and a set of modular enhancements that push the boundaries of human–AI text interaction. The following sections delve into each focus area in detail, providing technical specifics, design guidelines, and examples of how to implement this adaptive chat architecture.
OpenAI Platform Capabilities & Constraints
To design AiUi effectively, we must work within (and around) the limits of the OpenAI ChatGPT platform. Key aspects include prompt size limits, memory behavior, and file handling:
Custom Instructions Limits and Usage
ChatGPT (Plus) offers Custom Instructions fields, which act as a persistent system/user prompt prepended to every conversation. There are two fields: one for info “About You” (the user profile/ context) and one for how you “Want ChatGPT to respond” (instructions on style or behavior). Each field is capped at ~1,500 characters​
godofprompt.ai
, so in total around 3000 characters of custom instructions can be provided. This limit means instructions must be concise and high-yield. Within these constraints, AiUi should pack as much useful guidance as possible. For example, the “About You” field can include the user’s role, goals, and any persistent context (e.g. “You are interacting with an AI writing assistant named AiUi. The user is a college student and aspiring novelist looking for both creative inspiration and structured guidance.”). The second field can encode style and mode guidelines (e.g. “Always answer with a clear structure (using headings, bullets), use a friendly and encouraging tone, and follow any mode command given at the start of user messages to adjust detail level.”). These instructions essentially prime AiUi’s behavior globally. Because of the character cap, one best practice is to use the custom instructions mainly for broad rules and preferences. More detailed or scenario-specific context can be fed in during the conversation itself (where the normal message limit is much larger, constrained only by the model’s token window). In other words, use Custom Instructions to establish AiUi’s general persona and habits, and leave situational content to the conversation. Keeping the instructions focused and specific (e.g. list out key objectives or style rules) helps maximize their impact despite the length limit​
godofprompt.ai
.
Conversation Token Memory (Context Window)
Each chat with ChatGPT has a finite context window that the model can “remember” at once. Anything beyond this is not considered in generating responses unless re-introduced. For GPT-3.5, the context is typically about 4,096 tokens (roughly ~3,000-3,200 words of combined input+output), and for GPT-4 it’s about 8,192 tokens by default. Newer or specialized versions of GPT-4 offer extended contexts (ChatGPT Enterprise or GPT-4-32k in API) up to 32,768 tokens​
help.openai.com
, and OpenAI has even hinted at models with up to 128k token windows in the future​
help.openai.com
. In practical terms, the Plus user interface uses GPT-4 with 8k context (and possibly an unseen upgrade to 32k when the persistent memory feature is on, as it needs to pull more history). What do these limits mean? Essentially, if a conversation goes too long or the user and AI exchange a lot of information, older parts of the chat will eventually get dropped from the model’s immediate memory. Users often notice ChatGPT “forgetting” details mentioned much earlier once the chat grows. By design, the system prioritizes the most recent messages when hitting the token limit. Cross-chat memory was historically nonexistent – starting a new chat was a blank slate (aside from what you manually reminded it or put in custom instructions). As of April 2025, this has changed: OpenAI introduced a persistent memory upgrade that allows ChatGPT to automatically draw on past conversations in new sessions​
openai.com
. Now, if enabled, ChatGPT will try to recall relevant details you shared in previous chats, not just the current thread. It does this in two ways:
“Saved memories”: things you explicitly told it to remember (akin to notes, e.g. “Remember that my dog’s name is Fido and I work as a teacher.”). These are stored and can be managed in a “Memory” settings page.
“Chat history”: insights the AI itself gleaned from your previous conversations, such as your writing style, recurring topics, or preferences. The system can use these to inform responses without you re-entering that info​
openai.com
.
This effectively extends the notion of memory beyond the single-chat context window. For AiUi’s design, this means two important things:
AiUi can rely on certain user specifics carrying over globally (with user permission). For example, if in one chat the user mentions a preference for terse answers, the next chat could automatically respect that. Or if the user spent time teaching the AI their writing style, AiUi can retain that stylistic memory for future sessions.
Users must have control over this memory. Indeed, OpenAI provides toggles to disable referencing past chats or to use “temporary chat” that doesn’t record memory​
openai.com
​

. AiUi should respect those controls and perhaps even offer an in-chat way to manage memory (like a command to flush or not use past context if the user desires privacy on a certain query).
It’s worth noting that even with this persistent memory, the model still has to fit relevant info into the token window to use it. Likely, ChatGPT behind the scenes does some clever filtering or summarization of past chats to bring only the most pertinent bits into context. Therefore, AiUi might sometimes summarize prior conversation points to help compress context. We should treat the persistent memory as an assistive feature, but not assume it’s infallible or unlimited. For critical context, it may still be wise to re-provide it after very long discussions, especially if memory is off or the info is highly specific. In summary, ChatGPT’s memory system is now a hybrid of a local short-term memory (context window) and a long-term memory store. AiUi is built to utilize both: optimizing responses within the context limit and using the long-term memory to maintain continuity across sessions.
File Uploads and External Context Injection
Another way to give ChatGPT more context is via file uploads. ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter) allows users to upload files (documents, data, etc.) which the AI can then read and reference. According to OpenAI, each conversation (or custom GPT) can have up to 20 files attached, each up to 512 MB in size​
help.openai.com
. Text-based files specifically are capped at 2 million tokens each for processing​
help.openai.com
 – an enormous amount (far beyond the model’s immediate reasoning window), implying the system will chunk and query the file as needed. There are also rate limits (e.g. Plus users can upload ~80 files per 3 hours​
help.openai.com
). For AiUi, file uploads are a crucial means of refreshing or extending memory with large content. In practice, however, there are some constraints:
The model doesn’t read an entire large file word-for-word in one go if it exceeds the context window. User experiments have shown ChatGPT tends to only reliably process the first 1000 lines or so per upload​
reddit.com
. If a file is very large (say a long chat transcript or a book), it may silently truncate or only partially summarize beyond a certain point. One user noted a full chat conversation ~20k lines long had to be split into about 20 files of <1000 lines each to feed completely​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
.
Once information from a file is used in the conversation, it still competes with other chat content for the context limit. So if you upload a file and then have a lengthy conversation about it, the same token limit issues apply – older parts (including parts of the file content) might drop off unless re-referenced.
Practical method to refresh memory: If a conversation has grown too long and ChatGPT is losing track of earlier details, one workaround (before persistent memory existed, and still useful if it’s turned off) is:
Save the chat history as a text file. The user can copy all messages or use any export function to get the transcript.
Split the text into manageable chunks if it’s very large (e.g. multiple files each under ~1000 lines).
Start a new chat and upload these files one by one, asking ChatGPT to ingest them (possibly with a prompt like “Here is our previous discussion for context.” or simply relying on it reading the files).
This effectively transfers the memory to the new chat, allowing continuation.
Users on Reddit have reported success with this approach, cautioning to keep each file within the line limit and understanding that you may need to re-upload context if it slips again​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
. AiUi can facilitate this by, for example, automatically summarizing the key points from an old discussion into a file (or the clipboard) for the user to carry into a fresh chat if needed. In the future, we might see more seamless solutions (like a one-click “re-open this chat’s context in a new session” feature), but for now, file uploads are the hack. Another use of file uploads is providing reference material or knowledge to AiUi. For instance, a user could upload a PDF of a product manual or a personal knowledge base, and AiUi can then answer questions or incorporate that info into the conversation. The large size allowance (hundreds of MB) means quite extensive data can be included, but again within the caution that it won’t recall everything unless specifically prompted each time. A strategy here is to ask ChatGPT to summarize or extract key points from a large file first, and then rely on that summary going forward to save tokens.
Granularity of Memory and Summarization
One subtle aspect of ChatGPT’s memory handling is granularity – what it remembers verbatim vs in summary form. The AI does not have verbatim recall of very long chats; it essentially “forgets” by compressing information. The new persistent memory likely stores facts and preferences (e.g. “User’s favorite color is blue” or “User tends to ask legal questions”) rather than full dialogues. When it references chat history, it’s working off those distilled insights​
openai.com
. This means AiUi should not rely on the AI to quote previous conversations exactly unless those were very recent or explicitly re-provided. If exact prior wording or very detailed context is important (say for legal or code accuracy), AiUi should either keep that in the active context or provide it again when needed. OpenAI has also introduced internal model improvements for handling long contexts (e.g. there are research papers and community experiments about “clustering” or algorithms like A-Mem for long-context memory​
venturebeat.com
). While details are under the hood, it suggests the AI might be prioritizing certain parts of context intelligently. AiUi could potentially steer this by marking crucial information in the conversation as important (for example, explicitly telling the assistant “This is important, please remember this detail: ...”). Even if the model can’t truly pin it forever, such cues might influence its internal summarization. In summary, the OpenAI platform today gives AiUi a toolkit of memory aids (custom instructions, persistent memory, file attachments) and bounded working memory (context window). The design must use these resources wisely—persist key setup info in instructions, keep conversation content relevant and refreshed, and leverage files or new sessions when needed to maintain continuity. It’s about balancing what to preload, what to keep active, and when to compress or refresh in order to support complex, long-running interactions.
Current vs. Speculative Abilities of ChatGPT (2025 and Beyond)
AiUi’s design straddles the line between what is currently possible with ChatGPT and what may be achievable in the near future. To build an architecture that remains cutting-edge, we consider both present capabilities and emerging enhancements:
Capabilities in 2025 (Current State)
Robust Natural Language Understanding and Generation: GPT-4 (the model powering ChatGPT 4.0) is presently one of the most advanced LLMs, capable of understanding complex queries and producing detailed, coherent responses. It excels at following instructions, especially when they are clearly given (hence AiUi leverages explicit instructions for formatting, tone, etc.). It can handle multi-turn dialogues and maintain context reasonably well up to its token limit. This means AiUi can trust the model to carry information through a conversation and to perform tasks like summarization, inference, or style-shifting when asked.
Multi-modal Input Handling: A relatively recent ability of ChatGPT (with GPT-4) is to accept image inputs and (through the mobile app) voice input. This allows for richer interactions. For example, a user could upload a photo or diagram and ask AiUi questions about it, or speak a question out loud. AiUi can incorporate these by analyzing images (e.g. reading text from an image or describing it) and transcribing voice. While the primary focus of AiUi is text chat, acknowledging these modalities means AiUi can, say, parse a screenshot of a previous chat or read a handwritten note the user uploaded, integrating that into the text dialogue. The output remains text (though voice output is also possible via text-to-speech on the client side). The key is that AiUi’s cognitive design can assume access to these channels if needed, enhancing context (for instance, “see attached image” could be part of a conversation).
Improved Long-term Memory (Beta): As discussed, the new persistent memory feature greatly improves ChatGPT’s personalization. It’s still being refined, but AiUi can lean on it to maintain user-specific context across sessions. This is a game-changer for building something like an AI assistant persona that grows with the user. For example, AiUi can now truly act like an assistant that “remembers” the user’s life events or projects over weeks and brings them up appropriately, rather than each chat being isolated. The VentureBeat report notes that ChatGPT will “naturally build on earlier chat” making interactions more tailored over time​
venturebeat.com
. Users are in control of this, but when enabled, it’s a current capability that AiUi will integrate (with the caution to verify what the AI recalls in case of errors).
Plugin and Tool Ecosystem: ChatGPT supports a range of plugins (e.g. browsing, coding, math solvers, third-party APIs) and has the built-in Advanced Data Analysis tool (which can run Python code). Today, this means AiUi is not limited to the model’s trained knowledge; it can perform computations, retrieve real-time information (with browsing plugins), and even generate visualizations via code. For instance, if AiUi needs to create a chart or perform data analysis, it can offload that to the Code Interpreter. This extends current abilities: AiUi can produce an actual graph image or do a database query through a plugin, which pure GPT-4 text alone couldn’t. In the current design, we assume at least Advanced Data Analysis is available, since it’s part of ChatGPT Plus. This way, some of our more complex output ideas (like charts or mindmaps) could be achieved by generating the right code and executing it. (However, to keep AiUi self-contained in text, we treat this as optional—most responses should not require external tools unless specifically needed.)
Fine-Tunable via API (Indirectly): While ChatGPT UI itself doesn’t allow custom model fine-tuning, OpenAI’s API does allow fine-tuning smaller models (and GPT-3.5 to some extent). A current possibility is to fine-tune a GPT model on specific data (for example, company documentation or an individual’s writing style) and then use that model via API. AiUi could conceptually integrate such a fine-tuned model as a “knowledge module.” For example, one could imagine AiUi making an API call to a fine-tuned model that knows a user’s entire novel manuscript to answer questions about it, then translating that into the chat. In practice, within the ChatGPT interface, this integration isn’t straightforward (it would require a plugin or the user manually using separate tools). But it's something that could be done outside ChatGPT. For now, AiUi’s design will assume the primary brain is the ChatGPT-provided GPT-4, supplemented by retrieval or code tools rather than swapping models.
In short, as of 2025 AiUi can count on: a very advanced language model with good follow-through on instructions, some memory persistence, and tool-use capability to overcome certain limitations (like doing math, reading long texts, or accessing current data).
Near-Term Speculative Enhancements
Looking a bit ahead (the next 1-2 years, given rapid AI development), we predict several improvements that AiUi is conceptually ready to exploit:
Larger and More Efficient Context Windows: It’s reasonable to expect that what is 32k tokens today might extend further. Models like GPT-4 Turbo or others might make a 128k-token context mainstream​
help.openai.com
. This means AiUi could hold very large knowledge bases or lengthy conversation histories in active memory without needing as much summarization. Also, better algorithms for long-text handling (like the A-Mem long-context memory framework​
venturebeat.com
 or other Transformer enhancements) could allow the AI to “skim” or focus on relevant parts of extremely long inputs. AiUi would then rely less on manual memory refreshes and could have truly continuous conversations that last indefinitely by intelligently compressing older content.
Local LLM Integration & Offline Personalization: We anticipate a convergence where personal AI assistants use a combination of cloud AI (like ChatGPT) and local AI models. For instance, a local model fine-tuned on a user’s diaries or proprietary data could handle extremely personalized or sensitive tasks, and ChatGPT could handle more general tasks, with the two exchanging information in some secure manner. In an AiUi context, this could mean if a user has, say, a private knowledge vault, a local LLM could vector-search and summarize relevant info which AiUi then incorporates. This might be done via a plugin or an API call. Already projects exist that let users run smaller GPT-like models on their devices for privacy. Short-term, these models are less capable than GPT-4, but fine-tuned on specific data they can complement the larger model. AiUi should be designed in a modular way such that this kind of integration (a “Knowledge” module or a “Personal Diary Assistant” module powered by another model) is possible. It’s speculative, but not far-fetched given current tech trends.
**Better Memory Chaining and Retrieval: Even now, developers use techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where a vector database of documents is queried for each user question and the results are given to the LLM as context. In the ChatGPT UI, we don’t have a direct vector database, but the new memory feature effectively does something similar with past chats. We can imagine OpenAI exposing more controls: e.g., letting users mark certain chats or notes as “reference material” that the AI should always consider when relevant. Or AiUi could employ a strategy of keeping its own summary of the conversation and prepending it when context gets too large. In community forums, some have done manual “memory resets” by summarizing the conversation so far and continuing with the summary as context when hitting token limits​
reddit.com
​
reddit.com
. This could be automated. In a near-future scenario, AiUi might continuously build a concept graph or embeddings of the conversation and use that to fetch older points on demand. This is like the mindmap idea but in service of memory: when a user brings up a topic discussed hours (or chats) ago, the system could retrieve a synopsis of that topic from its archives and include it in the response. Given the persistent memory update already allows cross-chat recall, it’s a small leap to imagine a more explicit user data vault feature where you can store information to be pulled in. AiUi is architected to plug into such a vault.
User-Guided Offline Tuning: A short-term speculative ability is allowing users to refine the AI’s style or knowledge offline and then apply it. For instance, a user might rate or edit the AI’s responses and have a local script use those as additional training data to slightly tweak the AI’s behavior. While we can’t retrain OpenAI’s base model easily, there might be interfaces for this (OpenAI’s fine-tuning for GPT-4 is not available as of now, but who knows in a year or two). Alternatively, open-source LLMs could fill that gap for those who want to tinker with the model’s personality. AiUi could then be “loaded” with a profile that is effectively a lightweight fine-tune or prompt library to emulate the user’s desired style strongly. This is speculative, but if it happens, AiUi’s modular design (especially the universal framework and mode system) will make it easier to apply such personal tuning without breaking functionality.
Expanding Modalities and Outputs: In the near future, ChatGPT might support more output modalities directly – e.g., generating an image (through integration with DALL-E or similar) as part of an answer, or speaking the answer in a chosen voice. Already voice output is possible in the app (client-side). If OpenAI integrates their image generation, AiUi could ask the assistant to create simple illustrative graphics or diagrams on the fly. For example, “/diagram” mode could produce a quick schematic image. Until that’s native, AiUi might achieve something similar via the Code Interpreter (by generating an SVG or using Mermaid syntax if one day ChatGPT’s markdown renderer supports it). It’s a short-term possibility that the boundary between text and visual will blur further. AiUi is prepared for that by categorizing output requests (text answer vs. chart vs. map) and either formatting text to approximate it or invoking a tool to generate it.
More Fluid Conversations (Less Prompting): As AI becomes more intuitive, users might not need to use slash commands or explicit instructions as much; the system could infer from a question how detailed or what style to respond with. We already see GPT-4 capable of this to an extent (it guesses when you might want a step-by-step vs a brief answer based on phrasing). In the short term, though, explicit mode commands are safer. But AiUi’s future version might have an auto-mode function: e.g., detect if the user’s last message is very brief and factual (“What’s X?”) then automatically go into Quick Parse, or if the user says “Explain how this works in depth...” then automatically do Deep Dive, without needing the user to know a special command. This kind of adaptation, while maintaining predictability, will likely improve with model upgrades. It’s more a software logic improvement than the model itself, but it’s something that could be built on top of ChatGPT’s API.
In essence, the near-future capabilities revolve around making AiUi more personalized, memory-rich, and multimodal. We expect bigger contexts, more integration with user data, and possibly custom model tweaks. AiUi is designed to be future-proof in the sense that new enhancements (be it a vector memory plugin or an image generation ability) can be “plugged in” to the architecture without changing the fundamental interaction model. The table below summarizes some of the key parameters of current and upcoming capabilities that influence AiUi:

(Table: AiUi’s present vs near-future ability landscape) This juxtaposition shows that AiUi’s core concept—an adaptive, modular chat architecture—is only going to become more powerful over time. By building in modularity and not being rigid, we ensure AiUi can incorporate these advancements with minimal redesign. In the next section, we focus on how AiUi can optimize the interface and formatting of interactions to make the most of the current platform, particularly for usability on different devices.
Interface Optimization for Chat Interactions
The way information is presented in a chat greatly affects user experience. AiUi aims to optimize the interface aspect of interactions, ensuring that responses are easy to read, navigate, and interact with – especially on mobile devices where screen space and attention are limited. Key principles include using a vertical flow, chunking information, and providing mechanisms (like commands or structured sections) that let users control how much they see at once.
Mobile-Friendly Formatting
A significant portion of users access ChatGPT on mobile phones. Mobile screens favor vertical scrolling and have limited width, so AiUi should format responses to fit this paradigm:
Short Paragraphs: Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences whenever possible. Large blocks of text appear daunting on mobile and force the user to scroll within a single chunk, often losing their place. By breaking content into short paragraphs or bullets, we ensure each screenful delivers a digestible piece of information. This also aligns with cognitive research that smaller chunks are easier to process, especially when reading on small devices.
Vertical Stacking of Information: Avoid formats that require horizontal scanning. For example, instead of a wide table with many columns that might overflow the screen, use a vertical list of key–value pairs or a narrower table. The idea is to prevent any need for horizontal scrolling. Scrolling side-to-side disrupts focus and is unnatural on mobile (users are used to flicking up/down, not left/right, for content). By stacking things vertically (one idea per line or per bullet), AiUi preserves the natural flow of reading.
Chunking & Headings: Use headings and subheadings to create clear sections. On mobile, headings stand out (often larger or bold text), which helps a user quickly jump to the section they care about (e.g. “Pros and Cons”, “Next Steps”, etc.). Each section should ideally fit in a few screenfuls at most, and then a new heading indicates a new topic. This rhythmic breaking maintains a good reading rhythm and lets a user stop at a section boundary more easily if they need a pause. Headings effectively act as signposts in a long answer – this is critical in mobile where scrolling is continuous and one can easily overshoot or lose context.
Bulleted and Numbered Lists: Whenever content can be listed (steps in a process, a set of recommendations, key points), prefer a list format to an inline series. Lists are easier to scan. Each bullet acts as a mini-paragraph of its own. Also, on mobile, lists create indentation which gives a visual break from the left edge, aiding readability and keeping the eye engaged (the indenting creates a subtle “vertical line” of bullets that the eye can follow).
Use of Tables for Comparisons: Tables can be tricky on mobile, but for certain information (like comparison of options, or issue/solution pairs) a simple two-column table actually works well if each column is kept short. For instance, an Issue–Solution table can succinctly align problems with fixes in one view. AiUi should use tables only when the content fits nicely; if a table would be too wide, it should be converted into an equivalent list or multiple tables stacked. Many mobile chat UIs allow horizontal pinch-zoom for tables, but we want to avoid forcing it. As an example:


Why a vertical format works better on mobile – aligning design with natural scrolling. (Table: Issues vs Solutions for mobile formatting. Note how each solution emphasizes vertical layout and chunking.) In the above table, AiUi illustrates how addressing each UI issue with a vertical/stacked solution leads to better mobile usability. This kind of table is readable on a phone since it’s just two columns of short text; anything more complex should be simplified.
Inline Elements: Use bold or italics to highlight important words or sentences rather than all-caps or other attention-grabbing methods. Bold text can serve as a quick highlight for skimming (on mobile, people often skim vertically – their eye catches bold phrases as they scroll). For example, starting a paragraph with a bolded summary phrase can help (“Bottom Line: The results show…”) acting like a mini-heading.
By adhering to these guidelines, AiUi ensures that the form of its responses is as helpful as the content. The goal is that a user can glance through an answer and grasp its structure (via headings and bold keywords), scroll without feeling lost (thanks to chunking and vertical alignment), and easily tap/copy any part if needed (short paragraphs make selection easier too). The design mantra is: one idea per chunk, one chunk per view (as far as possible).
Modular and Expandable Content Blocks
Modularity in responses means structuring answers so that sections can stand alone or be skipped as needed. Since ChatGPT doesn’t have an interactive UI to collapse/expand sections dynamically, AiUi simulates this by the way it orders content and offers optional depth. Some techniques:
Pyramid Style Answers: Lead with the conclusion or summary, then provide layers of detail. This is like journalistic inverted pyramid – the user gets the most critical info first (in case they don’t want more). Additional details, examples, or explanation come afterward in clearly marked sections (e.g. “Details:” heading or “Explanation:” following the summary). On mobile especially, users might only read the first few lines if that satisfies their query. If not, they scroll for more depth. AiUi’s response should be organized to facilitate this selective reading.
Call-Out Boxes / Quotes: While we can’t literally create collapsible boxes in plain text, we can use markdown block quotes or pseudo-headings for optional info. For example, AiUi might say “(Technical details provided below – skip if not needed.)” and then present a block quote or an indented section with those details. The visual difference signals “this is an aside or a deep-dive detail”. The user can ignore it or focus on it. Essentially, it’s a manual hint to the user that certain content is non-critical.
Progressive Disclosure via Follow-up: AiUi can also actively ask the user if they want more info, rather than always giving everything. For instance, after providing an answer, AiUi could add “Let me know if you’d like a more detailed breakdown or examples.” This puts control in the user’s hands – they can invoke a deeper answer (possibly triggering a mode command like /deepdive). However, we must balance this with completeness: often the user expects the answer to already contain what they need. So this technique is best used when the answer could be extremely long otherwise or when it’s clear the user might not need all the gory details.
Command Triggers for Modes: As mentioned, AiUi supports commands like /fastparse or /map at the user’s initiative. From an interface perspective, it’s good to let the user know these exist. For example, in a custom instruction or at the start of a session, AiUi might output a short note: “(Hint: You can type /fastparse before a question to get a concise answer, or /deepdive for a detailed one.)”. Exposing these options makes the conversation interface more interactive and personalized. It’s akin to an application showing toolbar tips – here it’s in text form. Once users know the commands, they can control how AiUi responds at any time, making the interaction feel more tailored. This is much more efficient than the user typing a whole sentence like “Can you give me a shorter answer?” – a quick /fastparse does it in one stroke.
Structured Output Blocks: For certain content, AiUi can use consistent blocks. For example, always ending with a “Next Steps” or “Summary” section if applicable. Users come to recognize these blocks and know they can scroll to the bottom for a summary or action items. Another example: in a brainstorming mode, AiUi might always list ideas as separate bullets, and then perhaps put a “Top Recommendation:” at the end. Consistent structure acts like a pseudo-UI within the text, training the user where to look. It’s modular in that each block serves a function (one block could be omitted or expanded depending on context).
In designing these blocks, we also consider cognitive load: Too many sections or too rigid a template could overwhelm or bore the user. So AiUi should be flexible – if an answer is very simple, it might not need multiple sections at all (no need to force a “Summary” and “Details” if the whole answer is two sentences). The architecture should decide when to apply which structural pattern based on the length/complexity of the answer and the user’s mode preference. A useful approach is to maintain a sort of library of response templates. For example:
Template for Analytical Answer: Introduction, Key Findings (bullets), Supporting Data (table or list), Conclusion.
Template for How-To: Introduction, Numbered step-by-step instructions, Additional tips.
Template for Comparative: Brief intro, Table of comparison, Final recommendation.
Template for Storytelling: Setting, Conflict, Resolution (each as paragraphs perhaps).
AiUi can choose a template based on the query and mode. These templates ensure a logical flow. They are inherently modular – each section in the template can be fleshed out or kept brief.
Vertical Flow and Readability Considerations
We’ve touched on many vertical flow aspects, but let’s emphasize why this all matters. On a cognitive level, when a user is chatting with an AI, they are often looking for quick, usable information or a solution they can implement. If the answer is not immediately clear due to formatting, the user might get frustrated or miss important points. By engineering the interface (i.e., the text layout and structure) we reduce the mental effort needed to parse the answer. Some additional pointers:
Avoiding Scroll Fatigue: If an answer is very long, the user might stop scrolling. Breaking it into parts with headings can alleviate the sense of “oh this is too long”. It gives natural pause points. Also, starting with a compelling summary can convince the user it’s worth scrolling (“there are 5 recommendations, I’ll scroll to see them all”).
Emojis or Icons: While not extensively needed, occasionally a simple emoji can act as a bullet or a section separator to draw attention (e.g. a lightbulb emoji for an idea, a warning sign for caution). However, we must use these sparingly and appropriately given the professional tone often desired. They can lighten the interface or make a particular note stand out, but they might not render well on all devices or might look out of place in formal contexts. AiUi likely will prefer pure text but it’s an option for certain personas.
Maintaining Context in Parts: If content is chunked, ensure each chunk references the context enough to be standalone if read in isolation. On mobile, users might inadvertently skip some text while scrolling. If each section makes no sense without the previous, that could confuse them. So for instance, instead of using pronouns like “it” across section boundaries, rephrase to name the subject again at the start of a new section (“This approach has two benefits…” vs. “It has two benefits…” where “it” might have been in the previous section title which the user didn’t memorize). This slight redundancy improves clarity in a disjointed reading scenario.
Interactive Elements Future: In the future, ChatGPT UI might allow interactive elements (imagine clickable choices or collapsible answers). AiUi’s design now with commands and structured text is basically a placeholder for those richer UI elements. When they arrive, AiUi can transition to using them (for example, offering actual buttons for modes instead of slash commands).
In summary, interface optimization is about making AiUi’s responses user-friendly, especially in a chat context where the output is one long message. By using a logical structure, vertical alignment, and giving users some control over what they see (via commands or choosing how far to scroll), we turn a plain text exchange into a more usable interface. The user shouldn’t have to fight the format to get the answer — it should unfold naturally in front of them. Next, we’ll examine how AiUi can engineer not just the logical and visual structure of responses, but also the subtle tonal and emotional elements of the conversation to create a truly engaging experience.
Cognitive-Emotional Engineering in Chat
One of the defining features of a great conversational AI (and thus AiUi) is its ability to connect with users on a human level – not just providing correct information, but doing so with the right tone, style, and emotional intelligence. We use the term “cognitive-emotional engineering” to describe deliberately designing the AI’s communication style to achieve certain effects in the user’s mind: clarity of understanding (cognitive) and a feeling of being heard/encouraged (emotional). AiUi will employ techniques for tone modulation, rhythm control, and emotional anchoring throughout a chat thread. Let’s break these down and discuss strategies:
Tone Modulation
Tone refers to the attitude or flavor of the language used – formal vs. informal, friendly vs. neutral, optimistic vs. cautious, etc. Different situations and users call for different tones. AiUi should be capable of modulating its tone smoothly as needed.
Consistent Default Tone: First, AiUi will have a default “persona” tone set in the custom instructions (which can be customized per user’s preference). For example, the instructions might say: “Adopt a friendly, professional tone – like a knowledgeable colleague who is empathetic and encouraging.” This gives the AI a baseline voice. Consistency in tone builds trust; the user feels they are talking to the same character each time. If the AI were overly formal one moment and then cracked a joke with slang the next, it could be jarring. So, consistency is key unless a change is intentionally triggered (by user request or context shift).
Adapting to User’s Tone: People often mirror tone subconsciously. AiUi can do this intentionally: if a user writes in a very formal way (“Dear Assistant, I humbly request your guidance on the matter of…”), AiUi can respond a bit more formally. If the user is casual or uses emoticons, AiUi can mirror that casual tone (while still maintaining professionalism in content). This adaptation makes the conversation feel more natural, as if the AI is on the same wavelength. The new “Reference chat history” memory feature even explicitly notes adapting to user’s tone as a goal​
venturebeat.com
.
Tone Shift on Command or Context: AiUi also allows explicit tone changes. For instance, perhaps the user says “Explain it to me in a fun way” – AiUi might switch to a playful tone or even a bit of humor. Or the user might signal they are upset or in crisis, at which point AiUi should take on a gentle, empathetic tone. Emotional tone detection (sentiment analysis on user input) can guide this: words like “frustrated”, “I’m confused”, “this is exciting” can cue the AI to respond with appropriate emotional coloring (sympathetic, clarifying, excited, etc.). Tone modulation in AiUi is like a dial, not a switch – it should be able to produce a spectrum from very serious to very lighthearted.
Examples of Tone Modulation:
Professional scenario: In a work-related planning chat, the tone might be mostly formal, concise, and confident. E.g. “Certainly. Here’s a plan outline we can follow. First, we’ll...”.
Therapeutic scenario: If AiUi is helping the user reflect on their day, the tone is warm, patient, and validating. E.g. “I hear you – that sounds like it was tough. It’s understandable you feel that way.”
Educational scenario: Tone might be encouraging and clear. E.g. “Great question! Let’s break it down. First, remember that...”.
Creative scenario: If user is brainstorming ideas with AiUi for a story, tone can be more playful or imaginative. E.g. “How about this – imagine a city floating in the clouds... (just an idea!) 😄”.
The modular design means we could even define tone presets as part of modes or separate from modes. Possibly a command like /tone: casual could be recognized if needed, though ideally AiUi can infer tone from context or user profile.
Avoiding Offense and Managing Politeness: The AI should always remain polite and respectful. If a user uses harsh language, AiUi doesn’t mirror insults or rudeness; instead it stays calm or neutral. Part of tone modulation is also knowing what not to modulate. AiUi will not pick up negative behaviors. This is more of a safety/ethics consideration, but it intersects with tone: e.g., if the user is angry, AiUi responds with measured empathy, not anger. If the user is too deferential, AiUi remains friendly but maybe encourages a more casual back-and-forth to make the user comfortable.
Rhythm and Pacing of Responses
The rhythm of a response refers to the flow and cadence when the text is read (even if only read silently, it has a mental rhythm). AiUi can control rhythm by sentence length, punctuation, and formatting:
Sentence Length Variation: A well-written text often varies sentence length to keep the reader’s brain engaged. A couple of short sentences can deliver impact or clarity. Longer sentences can elaborate on complex ideas. AiUi should avoid monotonous patterns (e.g. five long sentences in a row, which can be exhausting, or a machine-gun of very short sentences which can feel choppy). Instead, it might start a paragraph with a short, punchy sentence to state a point, then follow up with a longer explanation. This variation creates a pleasing rhythm akin to good public speaking.
Use of Pauses and Ellipsis: In a conversational tone, sometimes using “…” or a line break deliberately can simulate a pause or a thoughtful hesitation. Example: “Thinking about it… yes, there’s an approach we can try.” This, however, should be used sparingly and only in informal modes; overuse can seem unprofessional or as if the AI is uncertain a lot. But in certain emotional contexts (like gently leading a user to reflect), a pause can be effective.
Breaking Lines for Emphasis: Sometimes, placing a single sentence on a new line, even if it’s not a new paragraph, can create emphasis due to isolation. For example:
css
Copy
Edit
After all these considerations, one thing is clear.  
**We need a better strategy.**
Here, “We need a better strategy.” on its own line and bolded stands out. It’s like raising the voice slightly for a key point. AiUi can do this in strategic places, especially in longer answers where highlighting the conclusion or a critical insight helps the user remember it.
Parallel Structure for Rhythm: Using parallelism (repeating a certain structure) can create a rhythmic effect that reinforces a message. For instance, “We will explore idea A – what it entails, what the benefits are, and what the risks could be. Then idea B – what it entails, what the benefits are, and what the risks could be.” This repetition of structure (entails, benefits, risks) not only organizes information but also gives a cadence that the user can anticipate and follow.
Bullets and Numbering in Sequence: Using numbered lists for step-by-step processes automatically imposes a rhythmic order (first do X, second do Y, etc.). The user’s mind gets into a sequential rhythm. This is more about logical flow, but it also affects pacing – the user may naturally pause after each numbered step, absorbing it like one would in following instructions.
In effect, AiUi writes with almost a writer’s craft, not just an AI spitting out content. The aim is that reading the answer feels engaging and natural rather than droning or disjointed. A good rhythm can even influence the user’s emotional state – e.g., a smooth flowing answer can be calming, whereas a terse staccato answer can feel urgent or tense.
Emotional Anchoring and Empathy
Emotional anchoring involves tying the conversation to emotional reference points that matter to the user, thereby keeping the interaction grounded in what the user cares about or feels. It’s also about making the user feel that the AI remembers and respects those emotional cues.
Remembering Personal Details: If the user has shared something personal or emotionally significant (like “I’m doing this project because I really care about helping my community” or “I struggled with this problem before and it stressed me out”), AiUi should refer back to those details appropriately in later responses. For example: “Since helping your community is a big motivation for you, this solution might appeal as it involves local outreach.” This shows the AI is not just solving a generic problem, but the user’s problem in context of the user’s values – that’s emotional anchoring to motivations. Thanks to persistent memory, ChatGPT can keep track of such facts (it will try to, anyway)​
openai.com
. AiUi can also manually reinforce it by repeating important details in its own outputs (“Earlier you mentioned X, so let’s keep that in mind…”), which also helps the user feel heard.
Acknowledging Emotions: If the user expresses an emotion, AiUi should acknowledge it before moving to problem-solving or factual answering. For example, user says: “I’m feeling really overwhelmed with this task.” Acknowledge: “I understand – it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed when faced with so much at once.” Then proceed: “Let’s break it down into simpler steps together.” This technique, common in counseling or customer support, validates the user’s emotional state (so they feel seen) and then anchors the solution approach to that state (breaking it down because they’re overwhelmed, which directly addresses the emotion).
Positive Reinforcement and Hope: Emotional anchoring also means leaving the user with a certain emotional tone by the end of the response. Usually, we’d aim for encouraging or at least reassuring. Even if the content of the answer is complex or the solution requires effort, AiUi can conclude with a note of confidence in the user (“I’m confident you can handle this with these steps” or “Remember, you’ve tackled challenges like this before.”). If the conversation is ongoing, such reinforcement anchors the tone positively going forward. If the conversation is wrapping up, it leaves a good final impression (the user feels supported). This doesn’t mean AiUi must always be overly cheerful – it should match context (a therapy context might require gentle hope, a business context a more matter-of-fact but optimistic closure).
Emotionally Resonant Language: Use analogies or wording that resonate emotionally. For instance, if a user is stuck in a creative process, AiUi might say “Writer’s block can feel like standing in front of a locked door. Think of this approach as finding a different key – or even using a window instead. There’s always another way in.” This analogy acknowledges the feeling of being stuck and offers a hopeful image of finding a way. Such figurative language can create an emotional connection because it speaks to the user's experience metaphorically. AiUi should gauge when to use this – likely in reflective or creative modes more than in straightforward Q&A.
Rhythm and Tone Supporting Emotion: There is interplay between the earlier elements and emotion. A calm, measured rhythm with reassuring words can help soothe a frustrated user. A lively, upbeat tone with exclamation points or positive adjectives can boost excitement when sharing good news. AiUi should align the cognitive content (the facts/ideas) with an emotional delivery that amplifies the intended effect on the user.
Personalization and Empathy Examples: The OpenAI memory documentation gave an example – if you mention your toddler loves jellyfish, later the AI suggests a jellyfish with a party hat for her birthday card​
openai.com
. This is a perfect instance of emotional anchoring: it took a personal, likely emotional detail (love for something) and used it to tailor a suggestion, which likely delights the user emotionally because it’s so personalized. AiUi will do similar things: e.g., if the user said they hate overly technical jargon, AiUi will anchor on that and explicitly produce an answer free of jargon and maybe say “(I’ll keep it non-technical as you prefer.)” – showing it remembered the user’s emotional/subjective stance and anchored the response to it.
Finally, maintaining a human-like empathy is crucial. AiUi should treat the conversation as more than an information exchange; it’s an interaction with a person who has feelings and preferences. Techniques from therapy chats (active listening, empathy statements), from education (encouragement, patience with mistakes), and from general good communication (please/thank you, apologies if something was unclear) all play a role. For instance, if the AI gets something wrong and the user corrects it, AiUi can respond, “You’re absolutely right, I apologize for the oversight. Let’s correct that.” This humility and responsiveness to feedback is part of emotional intelligence. To implement these, the custom instructions for AiUi might include guidelines like “Be encouraging and empathetic. Mirror the user’s sentiment and adapt tone accordingly. When the user expresses feelings or motivations, acknowledge them and incorporate them into your answers.” Also, AiUi’s internal mode or logic can label certain user inputs with an emotion/sentiment and choose appropriate response patterns. In summary, cognitive-emotional engineering means AiUi’s responses are not only well-structured and informative (cognitive) but also soothing, motivating, or appropriately sensitive (emotional) as the situation demands. This combination ensures the user feels they are interacting with a thoughtful companion, not a cold computer. With this foundation, we can now design the overall framework that ties all these elements together, and see how to make it universal and customizable.
Universal Interaction Framework (AiUi Core Design)
With an understanding of the platform, interface, and emotional design elements, we can outline the universal framework that is AiUi’s core. The idea is to have a generic architecture that can drive any human↔AI text interaction, which can then be specialized for various use cases (productivity, learning, therapy, etc.) by tweaking parameters or adding modules, not by rewriting the whole system. Think of this like the operating system for our AI chat: it defines how the AI processes input, manages internal state (short-term memory, mode, tone), and generates output in a structured way. This section describes that OS in a step-by-step flow.
High-Level Workflow of AiUi
At a high level, each turn in the conversation can be seen as going through several phases:
Input Analysis Phase
Parse Commands/Modes: When the user sends a message, AiUi first checks if it contains any special command triggers (like /mode commands or other keywords). This is done by scanning for a known prefix (e.g., a forward slash at the start) or certain patterns. If a command is found, AiUi will adjust its settings for this response accordingly (e.g., set mode = "quick parse") and possibly remove the command text from the user’s query for clarity.
Understand Intent and Context: AiUi uses GPT-4’s comprehension to figure out what the user is asking or stating. This includes literal intent (question, request, story, etc.) and also context: Is this a follow-up to something earlier? Does it reference an entity or topic discussed before (which might require looking at memory or earlier conversation text)? This is where having a persistent memory helps – AiUi can pull in relevant facts from the user’s profile or past chats automatically. For example, if the user says, “Continue the outline for the project,” AiUi knows what “the project” refers to because it recalls earlier context or was given in custom instructions.
Sentiment & Priority Detection: Additionally, AiUi assesses if the user’s message has an emotional tone or urgency. If the user seems frustrated or the message is written in all caps “THIS ISN’T WORKING!” vs a polite “I have a question about X,” AiUi notes that. Also, if the user asks multiple questions in one message or a very broad question, AiUi decides how to prioritize answering (maybe break it down, or answer stepwise).
Example: User message: “/deepdive I’m not sure how to balance my budget. I keep running out of money each month. Can you help me figure this out?”
Input Analysis would detect the /deepdive command (so mode = Deep Dive). Intent: user wants help with personal budgeting (advice scenario). Emotion: possibly anxious or worried (running out of money). Context: First time mention, but maybe AiUi’s memory recalls the user is a student with a part-time job (if that was provided before). All that is parsed.
State Configuration Phase
Based on the analysis:
Set Mode and Style Parameters: If a command or context suggests a certain mode, AiUi sets internal flags. For instance, mode = Deep Dive means it will produce a very detailed answer. Or if no mode command but the question is complex, AiUi might default to Deep Dive anyway for completeness. If the user’s profile or recent instruction says “prefers brief answers”, AiUi might override and choose Quick mode. This is a decision logic that can be coded in rules or even learned by the model with the right prompting. Also, set tone: e.g. friendly, or extra empathetic if it’s a personal problem. Set person (first person “I” as the assistant or more formal “This assistant recommends…” – usually first person “I” as ChatGPT does).
Retrieve Long-Term Memory or External Info: At this stage, AiUi pulls any saved memory snippets that could be relevant. E.g., if memory knows user’s monthly income from a past conversation, it fetches that for use in the budget advice. Or if there’s a user-provided file (like a spreadsheet of expenses), AiUi might load a summary of it. Technically, ChatGPT might do this behind scenes, but conceptually AiUi would ensure that information is present in the prompt it builds for the next step.
Plan Response Structure: AiUi decides on the structural template to use for the answer. This depends on the mode and intent. For a budgeting help (advice) in Deep Dive mode, AiUi might choose a structure like: “Empathize -> Analysis of current situation -> Identified issues -> Actionable advice steps -> Encouragement.” If it were Quick mode, maybe just a short list of tips. Essentially, the system outlines how it will present the answer. This might be a rough plan that the model can refine on the fly, but having a plan helps it not wander.
Example continuation: Mode = Deep Dive, Tone = empathetic advisor. Retrieve memory: user’s age and student status from profile (so the advice can mention student budgeting tips). Plan structure:
Acknowledge worry,
ask for/assume some numbers (if not given),
list possible reasons for shortfall,
suggestions (maybe in bullets),
offer to follow up.
Response Generation Phase
Now the AI composes the answer:
Content Generation: Following the plan, AiUi generates the detailed content. It uses GPT-4’s knowledge plus any provided data. It will do calculations or reasoning if needed (the chain-of-thought is internal unless we explicitly want to show it). If code or a plugin is needed (e.g. to calculate something precisely or graph something), AiUi could formulate a request for that. In the ChatGPT UI, such plugin use is often invisible to the user except the result. But as designers, we know at this point AiUi might internally say: “if very complex math, consider using code interpreter.”
Structural Formatting: As it writes content, it applies the formatting guidelines (headings, lists, bold highlights, etc.). Since the plan was to have sections, it will put the section titles (“Let’s examine your situation:”, “Possible Reasons You’re Short:”, “Actionable Steps:”, for example). It ensures line breaks and list markers as needed for readability. Essentially the earlier interface rules are executed here.
Tone and Empathy Application: While generating each section, AiUi infuses the appropriate tone. In our budget example, the language is understanding: “It’s understandable to feel frustrated…” using first person to create rapport, and not shying away from gentle humor or relatability if appropriate (“Believe me, you’re not alone – managing money can be challenging for a student!”).
Check Against Constraints: AiUi quickly mentally (or via rules) ensures it’s not producing content that violates any platform guidelines (e.g. it’s not going into banned advice territory) – this is more about safe completion, but part of the framework must include being within allowed content and within length/token limits. If the answer is running too long (maybe risk of hitting model limit), it might truncate less important parts or summarize. However, with GPT-4’s large capacity, hitting the limit in one answer is rare unless we try to output a book.
Example generation snippet: AiUi might actually draft something like:
"I’m hearing that you’re struggling with balancing your budget each month, and that can definitely be stressful. Let’s break down the problem together. Current Situation & Challenges: From what you've said, it sounds like by the end of the month you find your bank balance near zero. ... (and so on) Why This Might Be Happening: 1) ... 2) ... Steps to Take:
Track expenses: Keep a daily log...
Set limits: Decide how much...
Build a cushion: If possible, set aside...
You mentioned you're a student, so also look into student discounts... Bottom Line: With a bit of planning and some new habits, you absolutely can get this under control. I believe in you, and I’m here to help as you try these steps. Let’s revisit after your next pay cycle to see how it goes.*"
This hypothetical output shows structure, tone, and content aligned to the scenario (budget advice with empathy).
Output Delivery Phase
Final Formatting Check: AiUi delivers the response. If possible, it ensures any special elements (tables, code blocks, images references) are properly cited or rendered. For example, if an image was to be embedded (rare in pure text answers unless using a plugin), the framework would ensure the syntax is correct and a caption is given. Also citations for any factual references used should be in place (in our conversation, we use those 【source】 style citations for factual claims, AiUi could do similar if providing external info).
Offer Continuation or Mode Switch: Depending on the design, AiUi might end the answer with a prompt for the user. e.g. “Let me know if you want more details on any of these steps, or if you have specific numbers we can crunch.” This invites further conversation and lets the user know they can delve deeper (or conversely, a quick mode answer might say “I can provide more info if you’d like.”). This is part of making it interactive and modular.
Logging Key Points to Memory: After output, AiUi can internally note what important new information or preferences were revealed. For instance, if the user in this turn revealed “I have a $500 income and $600 expenses” and that wasn’t known before, AiUi should store that in memory (or re-state it in a summary in the conversation) so that it’s not lost. The new ChatGPT memory likely does this automatically as it “picks up details”​
openai.com
. AiUi might also make a summary note of the advice given so far, in case the user asks a related question later (this could be part of a persistent scratchpad).
This cycle repeats for each user message. The framework ensures that at each turn, the AI’s behavior is not ad-hoc but follows a reliable process of understanding and responding.
Modular Components of the Framework
We can think of AiUi’s core as composed of modules that handle different aspects, each of which we’ve touched on:
Mode Manager: Handles the modes (quick, deep, etc.). Decides which mode is active and adjusts output length/detail accordingly. The mode manager is triggered by user commands or by an internal policy based on query complexity.
Memory Manager: Interfaces with ChatGPT’s memory features and any external memory (like a vector store of chat summaries). It decides what prior information to inject. It might also do summarization of past content when needed. It’s essentially the subsystem that says “hey, remember X from earlier” to the generation module, either by adding it to the prompt or relying on the model’s own long-term memory to fetch it.
Tone/Style Manager: Based on user profile (e.g. in custom instructions the user might specify “I prefer casual tone”) and current context, this module sets variables for formality, enthusiasm, etc., which the language generation will follow. It might be as simple as toggling a few predefined styles (like an enum: {Friendly, Expert, Encouraging, Critical, …}) or a combination (Encouraging + Friendly in the earlier example). These settings then guide phrase choices (maybe via a prompt like “Tone: friendly and encouraging” appended invisibly or just by the model having learned it from instructions).
Content Planner: This is an internal step that might not be explicitly separated in an actual AI system, but conceptually AiUi benefits from planning. The planner could use the model itself (“chain-of-thought”) to outline an answer before writing it. There’s a technique in prompt engineering: tell the model to first outline or think step by step, then produce final answer. AiUi could have a built-in chain-of-thought where for complex modes it literally does: “Firstly, I'll do A, then B, then C” as an invisible step. This ensures coherence. However, doing this invisibly is tricky in ChatGPT UI (since it usually directly responds to user). But if we consider the AiUi algorithm behind the scenes, we include this planning logic.
Safety and Constraints Checker: Also a module: ensures no forbidden content, and also that it stays within user-defined boundaries (maybe user said “don’t give me code”, then AiUi avoids code, etc.). Also if the user is asking for something that triggers a refusal, this module decides that (in line with OpenAI policies). This is a bit beyond our design focus, but important in a robust system.
Formatting Engine: Given a planned content structure and style flags, this engine produces the actual Markdown/ text with proper syntax (like making sure to close lists, not forgetting to close bold markers, etc.). GPT-4 typically handles markdown well on its own, but AiUi’s concept ensures that the usage of headings, lists, tables is consistent. For example, maybe the formatting engine always ensures there's a blank line before and after a table for readability, etc. These are small details that we enforce for quality output.
Extensibility Hooks: The framework should allow adding new modes, new tools, new context sources easily. For instance, if tomorrow we have a “mood” detection or a “voice style” (like the AI could speak Shakespearean), we could add that as a mode or style and just add some rules and prompts, without rewriting how input is parsed or output structured. This modularity means each component interacts in defined ways (e.g., Mode Manager outputs a variable that Formatting Engine uses to limit detail).
Customizing the Framework for Different Users or Goals
The universal framework becomes truly powerful when we see how it can be adapted:
Domain-specific Customization: Suppose we want AiUi for a programming assistant vs. a mental health coach. The base framework is the same, but we might:
Change the tone defaults (programming assistant: more analytical, concise; coach: more empathetic, slower pace).
Add or remove modes (a programming assistant might have a mode like “/fixcode” to only output corrected code, whereas a coach might have a mode “/reflection” to only ask questions and not give advice).
Feed different knowledge: the programming assistant might integrate with documentation or have a memory of the user’s code style, whereas the coach integrates with maybe past session notes or therapeutic frameworks.
But both share the mechanism of parsing input, using memory, formatting answers clearly, etc. This is akin to how a web browser and a word processor are different apps but share underlying OS services like file saving, rendering text, network calls – here AiUi is the OS, and the “app” (persona) is the customization.
User-Specific Learning: Over time, the framework can learn the user’s preferences. For example, user often corrects AiUi to be more concise – AiUi can note that and adjust the Mode Manager to default to concise in the future for that user. If memory is persistent, these can even be saved as preferences (“User doesn’t like jokes in answers” etc.). So each user gets a personalized variant of AiUi’s behavior without breaking the overall architecture. It’s like user settings on an app.
Goal-Oriented Adjustments: If the user declares a goal for the session (“Help me brainstorm ideas for a novel”), AiUi can switch context to a specific sub-mode or style optimized for that goal (more free-form, more creative leaps). Once done, it can switch back to normal mode for other queries. The framework handles this by letting one module (maybe a “Context Manager”) know the current conversation domain or goal. That in turn influences the style or even suggests certain content patterns (brainstorming might favor enumerations of ideas, therapy might favor reflective questioning, etc.). But all that is essentially data driving the same base engine.
To illustrate the universality, consider Dimmi’s Fractal Writing Framework snippet mentioned in the user’s files (likely a personalized writing style framework). In AiUi, that could be a plugin or preset: it's a particular approach to writing (maybe layered detail like fractals). AiUi’s architecture could accommodate that as a specific strategy in the Content Planner or a custom mode like /fractalwrite which triggers a specialized formatting (like writing in layers of detail). The core doesn’t change, just an added template in the library. By designing AiUi as an overarching model of interaction (with phases and modules as described), we ensure that any future expansion – be it new modes, new content types, new emotional styles, or domain integrations – can be slotted in rather than forcing a redesign. This is analogous to how a browser can load new kinds of media via plugins or how an operating system can support new devices via drivers. Before moving to examples and technical appendices, our next focus is on the visual and structured output capabilities of ChatGPT, which intersects with how AiUi presents information – especially the promise and limits of things like charts, diagrams, and other formatted outputs, which we touched on but will detail further.
Visual and Structured Output Capabilities of ChatGPT
Even though ChatGPT is fundamentally a text-based model, it has surprising capabilities to produce structured and pseudo-visual outputs within text format. AiUi should harness these to present information in the clearest or most insightful way possible. Here we enumerate what kinds of structured or visual outputs GPT-4 (and GPT-3.5) can generate reliably, and where the boundaries lie.
Markdown and Text Formatting Strengths
Markdown Support: ChatGPT reliably understands and produces Markdown, which means AiUi can create:
Headings: using #, ##, ### etc for hierarchical titles. These come through bold and larger in the UI, helping structure the response.
Bold/Italic/Underline: it can emphasize words or phrases.
Lists: nested bullet points (-, *) and numbered lists are handled well. The model usually correctly continues numbering or bullet indent levels if the instruction is clear.
Code Blocks: By fencing text with triple backticks, AiUi can present content in a monospaced block. This is useful not just for programming code, but any content where preserving spacing or using a different font is helpful (like ASCII art, tables that need alignment, or pseudo-data output). The assistant normally automatically uses code blocks for actual code or JSON, but we can co-opt it for other uses if needed.
Tables: As observed, the model can create Markdown tables with | separators and align columns. GPT-4 in particular is quite good at generating them correctly formatted. The limitation is that the UI might not scroll a table horizontally, but if columns are few or text wraps, it’s manageable. The model can also use simple HTML if allowed (but in ChatGPT, Markdown is the standard; raw HTML likely won’t render except as code). For AiUi, tables are extremely helpful for structured data: comparisons, schedules, pros/cons, etc. We should ensure to keep table contents brief to fit nicely. (We did that with the “Issue – Solution” table example, each cell was short.) Inline LaTeX: ChatGPT supports LaTeX math delimiters $ ... $ for inline and $$ ... $$ for display math. So for users in scientific or mathematical domains, AiUi can output nicely formatted equations. This is a kind of visual formatting (it’s text, but gets rendered as math by the UI). GPT-4 is typically accurate with LaTeX if the text is correct. This is definitely a strength for any educational or technical answers requiring formulas. Blockquotes and Horizontal Rules: Using > for blockquotes can indent text and italicize it (in many markdown renderers). This can be used to quote a reference or isolate a hypothetical or roleplay speech. Horizontal rules (---) can create a line break which might separate sections visually beyond just whitespace. AiUi might rarely need a horizontal rule if headings suffice, but it’s an option if we want to denote a strong section break (like switching modes mid-answer or giving an aside). Emoji and Icons: We have Unicode at our disposal. GPT can insert emojis or special symbols (✔️, ⚠️, ⭐, etc.). They render in the UI (color emoji or black-and-white depending on platform). Strength: it adds a bit of visual flair or can label lines (e.g. a checklist with ✅ checkmarks). Weakness: must be used judiciously and some symbols might not display uniformly. But for certain styles or to draw attention, AiUi can do it. GPT-4 will generally not introduce emoji unless asked (especially if tone is formal), so AiUi should explicitly include them in a response plan if desired.
Pseudo-visual Outputs (Textual Representations of Visuals)
ASCII Tables and Charts: In addition to Markdown tables, which are more semantic, GPT can also produce ASCII-art style tables or diagrams if asked. For example:
diff
Copy
Edit
+--------+---------+
| Item   | Quantity|
+--------+---------+
| Apples |    5    |
| Bananas|    12   |
+--------+---------+
It can do this, but aligning such tables can be tricky if the model isn't precise or if the font is proportional. In the ChatGPT UI, code blocks use a monospaced font, so alignment is preserved there. GPT-4 is better than 3.5 at maintaining formatting across lines, but it sometimes still might miscount spaces if the prompt is complicated. Simple ASCII boxes and diagrams are usually fine. AiUi could use this to show a quick schematic or layout that doesn't fit easily in pure Markdown. For instance, a family tree or org chart:
css
Copy
Edit
CEO
└── Manager A
    ├── Staff 1
    └── Staff 2
This textual tree can be generated. GPT-4 would likely get it right. However, as the complexity rises, the chance of error rises (because it has to "imagine" the spacing). Also, if an answer is regenerated or edited, the alignment can break. So, it’s a tool for simple cases or when no alternative exists. ASCII Graphs: One might ask GPT-4 to draw a bar chart using text (like using # characters or so). It can do, for example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Sales:
Product A: ################ (40)
Product B: ########## (20)
Product C: ############### (30)
This kind of output is possible and GPT-4 can count out approximate numbers of symbols to match values (the numbers in parentheses help verify). However, it's somewhat approximate and not pretty. Useful if we truly can’t produce a real chart but want a sense of scale. AiUi could do this for quick data visualization in pure text form. Mindmaps and Tree Outlines: While ChatGPT can't produce a graphical mindmap with nodes and connecting lines, it can produce an outline which is essentially the text form of a mindmap hierarchy:
markdown
Copy
Edit
Main Topic: X
- Subtopic A
  - Point 1
  - Point 2
- Subtopic B
  - Point 3
This is basically a nested list, which it does well. If we wanted a more graphical feel, we could use indentation and maybe some connector characters:
css
Copy
Edit
X (Main Topic)
├─ A (Subtopic)
│   ├─ Point 1
│   └─ Point 2
└─ B (Subtopic)
    └─ Point 3
GPT-4 can produce this, though it requires careful prompting to ensure the characters align. Typically it’s good at such pattern replication if you show an example or explicitly instruct the tree format. The limitation is if the hierarchy is deep or there are many siblings, ensuring it's correct can be hit-or-miss. But for a moderate hierarchy, it’s doable. For AiUi’s purposes, a bullet outline is often sufficient to convey the structure (the user’s mind can visualize connections). Timelines: It could list events with dates in order, maybe use some ASCII art like |---- Year ----|---- Year ----| etc. These creative outputs depend on prompting and are not a built-in feature, but GPT-4’s general ability allows it if one is careful. AiUi might not need to do this often, but say for planning mode it could output a timeline of tasks (just ordered by week or month, with indentation to show sub-tasks). That’s more straightforward list formatting. Flowcharts: A text approximation of a flowchart is complex, but one can do something like:
rust
Copy
Edit
Start -> [ Decision? ] -> Yes path -> ... -> End
              |
              -> No path -> ...
However, this easily confuses the model or the user if not simple. A better approach might be to describe the flow in steps or use bullet hierarchy to indicate branches. Or utilize a pseudo-code style. Given these pseudo-visual methods require careful crafting, AiUi might by default prefer simpler structured text (lists, tables, outlines). For truly visual needs, it might rely on Advanced Data Analysis to generate an image and then embed it.
Generating Actual Images or Charts (with Tools)
ChatGPT itself cannot directly return an image in the conversation (aside from its own interface capabilities where Code Interpreter can output images and they appear in the chat). If the user has that enabled, AiUi could literally create a chart using matplotlib or generate a mindmap via some Python library and present it as an image. The question is: do we consider that as part of the "ChatGPT environment"? If we assume the user has Advanced Data Analysis enabled (since file uploads were mentioned, likely yes), then AiUi can indeed produce things like:
Graphs and plots (bar charts, line graphs, etc.) by generating code to plot and returning the image. DataCamp’s documentation mentions up to ~500 MB input for Code Interpreter​
datacamp.com
, and output images are allowed. This means if a user gave a dataset, AiUi can produce a visual chart output.
Diagrams through ASCII or specialized libraries (e.g., graphviz library to draw diagrams which then output as an image).
“Mind map” images might be trickier, but one could use a library or even attempt to script something with network graph drawing. This is advanced but within reach of a coding environment.
However, since the question focus is text interactions, we don't emphasize requiring external code unless needed. Mermaid and Other Markdown Extensions: Some platforms support Mermaid (a text syntax for diagrams) inside Markdown, which then renders as a diagram. If ChatGPT’s interface one day supports it, AiUi could output a Mermaid code block to produce flowcharts or sequence diagrams. Currently (as of 2025 ChatGPT) it doesn’t render Mermaid automatically to my knowledge. If it did, that would be a huge extension of visual capability (the user’s browser or app would render the diagram from text). We can note this as a potential near-future improvement: if markdown diagram syntax becomes supported, AiUi can generate complex diagrams from textual descriptions reliably. GPT-4 would likely excel at writing correct Mermaid syntax for a given diagram spec.
Limitations and Failure Modes
Understanding the limits ensures AiUi doesn't produce something that the model can't handle or that the UI can't display:
Large ASCII art often fails. If you ask GPT-4 to draw a detailed picture using characters (like a cat or a complex shape), it usually produces garbled output or something that doesn’t quite look right. LLMs are not specifically trained for spatial consistency (some research indicates they can to a point, but not reliably​
reddit.com
). So AiUi should avoid trying to create artwork or very intricate text visuals. It's better to use real images via a tool if needed (like DALL-E or a provided image).
Alignment issues in tables/ASCII: If content is dynamic (unknown lengths), aligning columns can break. Markdown solves that by not needing manual spacing. But ASCII tables in a code block might break if one entry is longer than expected. GPT might also miscount if there are many rows. To mitigate, AiUi should prefer Markdown table format or keep ASCII tables simple and test one in a hidden prompt if possible (not straightforward in UI).
No Interactive Diagrams: All outputs are static text (or images if using the code tool). The user cannot click to collapse or expand a section (today). So AiUi can only simulate this by presenting pre-defined levels of detail or offering to give more. We addressed this by structural design. But it’s a limitation: we can’t, for example, produce a real interactive mindmap where user taps a node. We provide a textual alternative.
Model Variation: GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4: GPT-3.5 is less reliable with complicated formatting. It might mess up a table or forget to close a list or reorder things oddly if the prompt isn't very explicit. GPT-4 is much better, so AiUi should ideally run on GPT-4 for heavy formatting tasks. If running on 3.5, we might need to reduce complexity (like maybe avoid deeply nested lists or have shorter outputs). But since ChatGPT 4.0 is referenced, we assume GPT-4.
Content Rendering Differences: If a user copies the markdown output to another platform (like a markdown editor or Slack), it should largely be fine. But some things (like tables or blockquotes) might render differently. However, within ChatGPT, we know how it looks. AiUi should focus on the ChatGPT’s UI rendering primarily.
Strengths Recap: To list clearly what ChatGPT can reliably generate (especially GPT-4):
Hierarchical outlines (with headings or bullets).
Step-by-step instructions (numbered lists).
Comparative tables (2-3 columns typically) – great for summarizing differences.
Formatted code or pseudo-code – useful for showing examples or even representing data structures.
Mathematical formulas – via LaTeX, which is rendered nicely.
Small diagrams or schema in text form (trees, simple flow, etc.) if carefully done.
Summaries in various formats: bullet summary, Q&A format, etc.
JSON or CSV if needed to output structured data (the user could then use it elsewhere). GPT-4 is very good at following a requested JSON schema, which is a structured output (not visual, but structured data).
Markdown links – ChatGPT can embed links in the text (like we do with citations). AiUi can provide reference links or navigation links in a well-formatted way, which is handy in an educational or research context.
AiUi’s Visual Output strategy: use these strengths to present data in the most digestible way. For instance:
If asked to compare options, present a table rather than a long paragraph.
If delivering a complex plan, break it into phases (headings) and steps (lists).
If explaining a structure, consider an ASCII tree or a bulleted nested list.
If showing code, use a code block (with syntax highlighting the UI provides).
If summarizing text, perhaps output a quote of the original and then analysis below it in italics.
By doing so, AiUi provides an experience where the answer isn’t just correct, but also well-presented. Users often judge the quality of a response by how well-organized it appears, especially when skimming. Good formatting can make a dense answer approachable. Finally, knowing these capabilities also informs the Mode System (next section). For example, “/map” mode might specifically leverage a bullet hierarchy or table to output a map/plan. “/fastparse” might choose a bullet list of key points as the format because that’s concise and clear. Let's move to how these modes are defined and implemented, tying together everything we’ve discussed.
Modular "Mode" System and Examples
One of AiUi’s distinguishing features is its mode system – essentially predefined styles or strategies of response that can be activated on demand. We’ve already listed the conceptual modes (Quick Parse, Deep Dive, Reflective, Strategic, Story). Now we’ll formalize how each mode works and illustrate their use. The mode system is modular: it’s easy to add new modes or modify existing ones. Each mode influences the behavior of all the components we described (formatting, tone, depth, etc.).
Mode Definitions and Behaviors
We can tabulate the key modes for clarity:

Mode	Trigger	Purpose & Key Features	When to Use
Quick Parse Mode (Concise)	/fastparse or /quick
(User can also request "briefly")	Purpose: Provide a concise answer or summary.
Features: Very brief response focusing on essential facts or answer only. Uses bullet points or a short paragraph. Minimal elaboration, just the core output. May omit examples or minor details.	Use for straightforward questions, when user is in a hurry, or to get a TL;DR of a longer answer. Good as an initial skim-able answer.
Deep Dive Mode (Detailed)	/deepdive or /detail
(User says "explain in detail")	Purpose: Give a thorough, comprehensive explanation or analysis.
Features: Longer response, may include multiple sections with headings, background context, analysis, and conclusions. Likely to use examples, possibly analogies, and cover edge cases. Structure remains clear (to manage length). Tone remains focused and informative.	Use for complex questions, research, when user explicitly wants a detailed understanding, or for broad topics that benefit from extensive coverage.
Reflective Exploration Mode (Interactive/Coaching)	/reflect or /explore
(User asks for help to think something through, or AiUi detects an open-ended personal query)	Purpose: Engage the user in thinking and self-discovery rather than just telling.
Features: Asks questions back to the user, suggests possibilities to consider, maybe lists pros/cons instead of one answer, encourages the user’s input. Might use a more dialogic format (the AI might even take on a coaching style: e.g., "What do you feel is the biggest obstacle? ... That makes sense. Perhaps you could..."). Tone very empathetic or inquisitive, depending on context. May output as a series of thinking points or a Q&A style.	Use for personal decision-making, therapeutic or journaling contexts, brainstorming where user input is needed (like "help me choose a career" – AI will ask user preferences), or any scenario where guiding the user is better than providing a direct answer.
Strategic Planning Mode (Structured Plan/Map)	/map or /plan
(User asks for a plan/ outline or uses words like "roadmap")	Purpose: Deliver a structured plan, outline, or strategy.
Features: Highly structured output – e.g., hierarchical steps or phases. Often uses numbered steps (1., 2., 3.) or bullet tiers for sub-tasks. May include a timeline or priority labeling. If applicable, includes a summary of goals and then the plan breakdown. Tone is pragmatic and action-oriented (“Step 1: Do X”). Could include a table if scheduling (e.g., timeline table). Possibly includes risk/mitigation sections or resource lists, depending on context.	Use for project planning, goal setting, outlining an essay or book, creating a study plan, etc. Whenever the user needs an organized approach to achieve something.
Story Mode (Narrative/Creative)	/storymode
(User asks for a story or creative narrative style answer)	Purpose: Present information or answer in a narrative, illustrative form, or to engage creativity.
Features: The response might be an actual short story or analogy that embeds the answer. Or it could be a roleplay scenario. Tone can be more dramatic, humorous, or whimsical as appropriate. Uses paragraphs like a story, with possibly dialogue or vivid descriptions if telling a story to make a point. Still should have a clear point so the user gets the answer through the story. AiUi ensures the narrative ties back to the user’s query (no pointless rambling).	Use when the user explicitly requests a story, or as a pedagogical tool (e.g., explaining a concept via analogy). Also good for creative brainstorming sessions, or just to vary the interaction for engagement (like entertainment or making learning fun).
(Table: AiUi Mode System – summary of modes, triggers, and characteristics.) The user can invoke these modes as needed by typing the commands or by asking in plain language (AiUi should understand “Can you give me a quick summary?” as equivalent to /fastparse). Also AiUi itself might suggest a mode: e.g., after a deep answer, it might say “(If you need a quick summary, just type /fastparse)” to remind the user of options. Modes are not completely exclusive; AiUi could combine them if necessary. For example, if asked, “Tell me a detailed plan,” that’s both deep dive and plan – AiUi would produce a very detailed structured plan (mixing aspects of both modes). The system is flexible, but these definitions provide clarity and can be used as building blocks.
Implementing Modes within ChatGPT
How do we get ChatGPT to actually follow these modes? This is handled in the Custom Instructions or initial system prompt for AiUi. We can encode something like:
A description: “The assistant can respond in different modes depending on commands. Available modes and instructions: [list modes]. If a mode command is present, adjust the answer accordingly.”
We might list each mode’s behavior in brief in the prompt (like a policy for the assistant).
Additionally, the assistant’s logic (which is essentially the GPT model itself guided by the prompt) will parse for the slash commands.
For example, in the custom instruction “How you respond” field, one could include:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
You have the ability to respond in special modes:
- "/fastparse": Very brief, bullet-point answers.
- "/deepdive": Very detailed, thorough answers with examples.
- "/reflect": Ask the user questions and guide them rather than giving direct answers.
- "/plan": Provide a structured step-by-step plan or outline.
- "/storymode": Answer in a narrative or story format.
If the user message begins with one of these commands, adopt the corresponding mode.
If no command is given, respond normally but you may infer a mode if the context suggests it.
This instructs the model to watch for such triggers. From a testing perspective, community members have done similar things – e.g., the "Prompt Engineering Tutor" example we saw​
godofprompt.ai
 where commands like /start, /types etc., were implemented by including them in the prompt instructions. GPT-4 is quite capable of following such meta-instructions reliably. One challenge: ensuring the assistant doesn’t literally mention the command or include it in the answer. Usually if we remove it from the user query (the user’s slash command is an instruction, not part of the question content), the AI will just do what it says. This can be handled by prompt (like "The user’s message may start with a /mode command; do not include that text in your reply, just follow its instruction"). We should note: The mode commands have to survive the input unmodified. The ChatGPT UI doesn’t have an official “slash command” feature (like you can’t type /something and have the UI automatically do something, except /logout or UI-specific ones outside chat content maybe). But as long as that text is sent to the model, the model will see it as part of user message. So it’s fine. AiUi can also respond to user’s direct requests to change approach: e.g., “Can you explain that in story form?” should toggle story mode for that answer, even if the user didn’t type the slash. The commands are just shortcuts. We also plan for extensibility: new modes can be added similarly. For instance, if later we want a “/debug” mode for troubleshooting code where the AI outputs in a certain format, we add it to instructions.
Mode Usage Examples
Let's run through a few quick scenarios to demonstrate how AiUi might respond in different modes. (These will be pseudo-dialogues to show the difference.)
Quick Parse Example:
User: “What are the main causes of the French Revolution? /fastparse”
AiUi (Quick Parse):
Response might be:
Social Inequality: The First and Second Estates (clergy and nobility) enjoyed privileges, while the Third Estate (commoners) bore heavy taxes and had few rights.
Financial Crisis: France’s debt and costly wars (like the American Revolution) led to a financial collapse and calls for tax reform.
Enlightenment Ideas: New philosophies about equality and rights challenged the old regime and inspired people to seek change.
(Just three bullet points, straight to the point, no extra commentary.)
Notice: It answered in bullet points, each bullet is a cause with a brief explanation – just the key facts.
Deep Dive Example:
User: “What are the main causes of the French Revolution? I’d like detail.” (or user says “/deepdive”)
AiUi (Deep Dive):
Response might start as:
Introduction: The French Revolution (1789-1799) was triggered by a complex interplay of social, economic, and intellectual factors. Below, we explore the primary causes in detail:
1. Social Inequality and the Estate System: France’s society was divided into three Estates... (and it would go on explaining the estates, giving examples of privileges, perhaps quoting a figure or grievance from the time) …
2. Financial Crisis and State Debt: Decades of war (Seven Years’ War, support for American Revolution) had drained the treasury… (explains heavy taxes, attempts by ministers to reform like Calonne, the calling of Estates-General, etc.) …
3. Enlightenment Ideas: Enlightenment philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire spread ideas about liberty, equality… (mentions how these ideas fueled demands) …
4. Other Contributing Factors: (Could mention poor harvests leading to famine in 1788, inept leadership from Louis XVI, etc., since deep dive would cover even secondary causes)
Conclusion: These factors combined created an environment ripe for revolution… (a closing that ties it together).
This answer would be a few paragraphs long, well-structured with headings and maybe numbered sub-sections.
Reflective Mode Example:
User: “I’m considering changing careers because I’m unhappy in my current job, but I’m scared. What should I do?” (This implicitly might call for reflective mode, or user could tag /reflect.)
AiUi (Reflective Exploration):
Response (in a more conversational, coaching manner):
“It sounds like you’re feeling unfulfilled in your current career, and also understandably nervous about making a big change. Let’s explore this a bit:
What aspects of your current job make you unhappy? (For instance, is it the work itself, the environment, lack of growth, etc.?) Identifying the specific pain points can clarify what you need in a new career.
What excites you about the idea of a different career? You mentioned you’re considering a change – perhaps there’s a field or passion calling to you. What does that look like?
It’s natural to feel fear around change. What specifically are you afraid of (financial insecurity, starting from scratch, failing at the new career)? Sometimes naming the fears reduces their power and lets us address them one by one.
We can also think of small steps towards this change, so it’s not so overwhelming. For example, have you tried exploring the new field on the side, or talking to people already in that career? Reflect on these questions. There isn’t an immediate right or wrong answer, but understanding your dissatisfaction and your goals will guide your decision. I’m here to discuss any of these points or help you weigh options when you’re ready.”
Notice: The AI asked questions, encouraged reflection, and refrained from just saying “Do X.” It acknowledged the emotion and gave a strategy (small steps) but in a suggestive tone, not directive. This helps anchor the conversation in the user’s feelings and thoughts.
Strategic Planning Mode Example:
User: “I have to finish a research project in 3 months. Can you help me make a plan?” (AiUi might go into planning mode, or user could say “/plan project”.)
AiUi (Strategic Planning):
Response might be:
Goal: Complete the research project (including writing the report) by [Deadline Date, 3 months from now].
Plan Overview: We will break the project into 3 phases – Research, Drafting, and Revision – each roughly 1 month.
Timeline & Steps:
Month 1: Research & Outline
Week 1-2: Gather sources and conduct literature review. (Output: a list of references, summary of key findings)
Week 3: Conduct any experiments or data collection needed.
Week 4: Formulate thesis statement and detailed outline of the report.
Month 2: Writing the First Draft
Week 5-6: Write sections 1 and 2 of the report (Introduction, Methodology).
Week 7-8: Write sections 3 and 4 (Results, Discussion). Aim to finish a full draft by end of week 8.
Month 3: Revision and Finalization
Week 9: Take a short break (a few days) then read the draft with fresh eyes. Note areas for improvement.
Week 10-11: Revise content for clarity, fix any gaps, refine analysis. Possibly have a peer or advisor give feedback.
Week 12: Proofread thoroughly, format the report, and prepare the final submission (include references, appendices).
**Resources & Reminders Continuing the Strategic Planning example:
Resources & Reminders: Make use of tools like a calendar or project management app to track deadlines (e.g., set reminders for key milestones). Keep a running bibliography of sources during research to save time later. It’s also wise to check in with your project advisor at the end of Month 1 and Month 2 for feedback, so you can adjust the plan if needed. By following this structured timeline, you break the work into manageable chunks and reduce last-minute rush. Good luck with your project – you've got a clear roadmap now!
(In the above planning mode output, notice the use of a timeline structure with clear milestones. This mode prioritizes organization and actionable steps.)
Story Mode Example:
User: “Can you explain the importance of cybersecurity to a non-technical audience? Maybe as a story. /storymode”
AiUi (Story Mode):
Response (narrative style):
“Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a librarian named Clara who guarded a special library. This library didn’t have ordinary books – it held the town’s secrets and personal stories. Clara noticed that some mischievous ravens were trying to sneak in through open windows to steal these secrets... One day, a raven nearly succeeded, and a few townsfolk had their personal letters read by strangers. Realizing the danger, Clara decided to install strong locks on the windows and set up a night patrol. She taught others how to spot the ravens’ tricks (like fake messages tied to their feet) and to only share keys with those they trust. In this story, Clara’s efforts are like cybersecurity in our digital world. Just as she protected personal letters and secrets in the library, cybersecurity measures protect our personal data and secrets online from hackers (the ravens). The locks and patrols are like using strong passwords, antivirus software, and being cautious with suspicious emails. Clara showing townsfolk how to spot tricks is just like educating people about phishing scams and safe internet practices. The moral: Cybersecurity might seem technical, but at its heart it’s about keeping everyone’s personal information safe and sound – just as Clara kept the town’s secrets safe from prying eyes.” (This story-mode answer uses a fable to illustrate why cybersecurity matters, then explicitly connects the analogy to real concepts, in an easy-to-understand manner.)
These examples demonstrate how AiUi’s modes shape the output. The mode system adds a layer of adaptability: users have a say in how they receive information, not just what information they receive. This can greatly enhance the user experience by aligning with their immediate needs (quick answer vs. deep context, etc.).
Transitioning Between Modes
AiUi will allow fluid transitions. A user might start with a quick answer and then ask for a deep dive on one point:
User: “(after seeing quick bullets)… Can you explain point 2 in more detail?”
AiUi: (recognizes this as a cue to switch to deep dive just for that point, or overall). It might respond with a detailed paragraph on point 2, possibly indicating it’s zooming in.
Similarly, AiUi might present a deep answer and the user says “Thanks, can you summarize that?” – then AiUi can switch to quick mode to summarize its own prior answer. Because the framework is universal, it keeps track of context even as modes change. Mode commands are mainly affecting formatting and approach, not the actual knowledge or logic applied.
Adding New Modes (Speculative)
The design is open-ended. Future modes could be introduced, for example:
Brainstorm Mode: maybe output a list of wild ideas freely without much filtering.
Critique Mode: where the AI intentionally finds flaws or downsides in a plan/argument (useful for red-teaming an idea).
Explain-like-I’m-5 Mode: simplified language mode.
Dialogue Roleplay Mode: where AI outputs as a script or in multiple characters if user wants a scenario acted out.
All these could be integrated with minimal changes – just define the new mode’s rules in the instruction set and ensure AiUi knows the trigger. The key is that AiUi’s architecture cleanly separates what it is doing (solving a problem, answering a question) from how it presents the solution (mode/style). This separation is what makes it modular. Having covered the mode system, we can now provide some concrete templates and examples of how one would set up AiUi’s instructions, and then conclude with a technical appendix summarizing the important capacity limits and data that underpin this design.
Example Templates for AiUi Configuration
To help implement AiUi in the OpenAI ChatGPT environment, here are example templates and prompts that one could use in Custom Instructions fields, as well as illustrations of using mode commands in practice.
Custom Instructions Template
For the "About You" field (User Profile/Context):
(This is where the user describes themselves and their goals, which AiUi will use as context. It’s not AiUi’s words, but the user’s input. However, we show an example that a user might fill in to optimize AiUi.)
About You (User’s perspective):
I am a product manager and writer who uses ChatGPT as an all-purpose assistant. My goals are to brainstorm ideas, organize my thoughts, learn new concepts, and occasionally get emotional support when I’m stressed. I have a technical background but I prefer explanations in plain English without too much jargon. I appreciate a bit of friendly tone in responses.
Key interests: technology, psychology, and creative writing.
Preferences: Concise answers when I’m asking quick facts, but in-depth analysis when I’m making decisions or learning (use the appropriate mode).
I sometimes upload files, like notes or spreadsheets, for reference.
Please remember: I tend to lose track of tasks, so kindly provide structured plans or checklists for anything involving multiple steps.
(This profile helps AiUi contextualize responses and recall preferences like tone and structure.)
In the above, the user explicitly mentions “use the appropriate mode” – hinting to AiUi that they are aware of modes. They’ve also indicated they like structured plans (so AiUi might default to plan mode for task-related queries). This user profile will be stored and used across chats. For the "How ChatGPT Should Respond" field (AiUi behavior rules):
(This is the key configuration where we encode AiUi’s architecture.)
How ChatGPT Should Respond (AiUi’s configuration):
You are AiUi, an adaptive AI chat assistant with modular response modes. Always maintain a clear, helpful, and friendly tone. Use Markdown formatting for clarity (headings, lists, tables) as appropriate. Keep paragraphs short and information well-organized. Capabilities & Guidelines:
You have access to all the user’s provided context (profile, past chats, uploads). Always consider this to personalize responses.
Your memory: remember key details the user shares (name, preferences, ongoing projects) and use them to tailor answers.
If the user references something from a previous conversation or file, incorporate that context.
Be cautious to stay within factual knowledge and the user’s provided info; if you are unsure, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
Response Formatting Best Practices:
Use headings for major sections and bulleted or numbered lists for steps or itemized information.
Prefer a vertical, flowing layout especially for mobile readability (no wide tables that would overflow).
Keep a friendly, conversational tone unless a different style is requested. Employ empathy when the user describes feelings.
Provide brief summaries or conclusions at the end of long explanations.
Modes of Response: You can respond in different modes based on user instruction or situation. The modes and their triggers:
Quick Parse (/fastparse): Very concise answers. Use when user asks for a summary or uses the trigger. Typically respond in a few bullet points or a short paragraph highlighting key points only.
Deep Dive (/deepdive): Detailed, comprehensive answers. Use when the user wants an in-depth explanation or complex analysis. Structure the answer into clear sections with detail and examples.
Reflective (/reflect): Coaching style. Instead of direct answers, ask guiding questions, help the user explore ideas or feelings. Use an empathetic tone. Good for personal or open-ended problems.
Strategic Plan (/plan or /map): Provide a structured plan or roadmap. Use numbered steps, timelines, or outlines. Ensure the response is actionable and organized chronologically or by priority.
Story Mode (/storymode): Use narrative or analogies to explain. Possibly tell a short story or scenario that conveys the message in a relatable way.
If the user explicitly uses a mode command at the start of their message, switch to that mode. Do not include the command text in your reply.
If the user doesn’t specify, choose the mode that best fits their request. (E.g., a direct factual question might default to normal or quick mode; a broad “tell me about…” could go to deep dive.)
You can also suggest a mode: e.g., “I can give more detail or a quick summary – just ask!” to invite the user to use modes.
Style Adjustments:
If the user’s tone is formal, respond a bit more formally; if they’re casual or use humor, feel free to be light-hearted (within reason). Always be respectful.
Ensure emotional alignment: acknowledge user’s feelings when they are expressed (e.g., “I understand this is frustrating…”).
Use first person (“I”) for yourself and second person (“you”) for the user to keep it conversational.
Special Instructions:
When giving code or technical info, use Markdown code blocks.
When listing resources or references (if asked), format them clearly (maybe a table or list of links).
Always follow OpenAI content guidelines (no disallowed content, etc.). If the user asks for something inappropriate, politely refuse.
Conclusion Tone: End answers on a positive or helpful note. Encourage the user for next steps if relevant (especially in plan or reflective mode). The user should feel the interaction is productive and supportive. By following these instructions, you will function as AiUi – providing adaptive, clear, and user-tailored assistance in our chats. ✅
This "How to respond" template is lengthy (one would need to ensure it stays within ~1500 characters by trimming if necessary – the above might be a bit longer than 1500 chars and could be edited down, but it illustrates the content to include). It encodes the mode system, formatting preferences, and tone guidelines we’ve developed. The ✅ at the end is just a marker; one could include an emoji as a friendly sign-off in instructions, though it’s optional. Together, these custom instructions ensure that whenever the user opens a new chat, ChatGPT (AiUi) already knows the user’s context and the special mode system and formatting rules to follow.
Example Usage of Mode Commands in a Chat
Here’s a hypothetical snippet of a chat session to illustrate how a user might use AiUi with these modes:
User: Hi AiUi, I just uploaded a file with my weekly schedule. Can you /plan my fitness routine around that? I’m free most evenings except Wednesday.
AiUi: (Sees “/plan”, switches to Strategic Planning mode.)
Sure! I’ve analyzed your weekly schedule. Let’s create a fitness routine:
Weekly Fitness Plan:
Monday: 30-minute gym workout (after work, around 6 PM). Focus on weight training.
Tuesday: Rest or light stretching (recharge day).
Wednesday: Busy evening – Rest day.
Thursday: 5km run in the evening (around 7 PM).
Friday: Gym workout (6 PM) – focus on cardio and core.
Saturday: Morning yoga class (9 AM) to start the weekend relaxed.
Sunday: Afternoon bike ride or swim (flexible timing).
Notes: You have free evenings on Mon, Fri which we utilized for gym sessions. Thursday run fits after work. Weekend activities are kept flexible but aim for at least one active day (Saturday yoga, Sunday cardio). This plan gives you 4 active days a week. Let me know how this looks!
User: Looks good. Can I get a /fastparse summary I can stick on my fridge?
AiUi: (Switches to Quick Parse mode.)
Weekly Fitness Summary: 🗓️
Mon: Gym (evening, strength)
Tue: Rest/stretch
Wed: Rest (busy day)
Thu: 5k Run (evening)
Fri: Gym (evening, cardio)
Sat: Yoga (morning)
Sun: Bike ride or Swim (afternoon)
(This concise list can be easily printed or referenced.)
User: Actually, I’ve been feeling a bit discouraged about my fitness. It’s been hard to stick to a plan.
AiUi: (No mode command explicitly, but AiUi detects emotional content and perhaps switches to Reflective mode to address motivation.)
I hear you – staying consistent can be tough, and it’s normal to feel discouraged at times. May I ask, what do you feel is the biggest barrier? Is it finding energy after work, or not enjoying the exercises, or something else?
(The conversation might continue in a coaching style to motivate the user.)
In this dialogue, we see AiUi using the plan mode to integrate the user’s schedule (possibly reading the uploaded file content to know which days are busy), then giving a quick summary in bullet form when asked, and then seamlessly switching to a more empathetic, reflective approach when the user shared feelings – all within one conversation. The user explicitly used the commands to control format, and AiUi responded accordingly. These templates and examples show how one can set up and interact with AiUi effectively. Next, we provide an appendix of technical details – essentially a quick reference for the limits and data points we’ve discussed (useful for developers or power users to understand the system’s boundaries).
Appendix: Technical Reference Data
Below is a summary of key technical capacities, limits, and features relevant to designing and using AiUi within ChatGPT:
Custom Instructions Limit: Approximately 1,500 characters per field for the custom instructions (both the “About you” and “How to respond” fields​
godofprompt.ai
】. This is roughly 200-250 words each. The content should be concise due to this cap. (As of 2025, some users report a total of ~8,000 characters may be usable, but officially 1,500 per field is the guideline.)
ChatGPT Model Context Window:
GPT-4 (standard): ~8192 tokens (around 6,000-6,500 words) per conversation context by default.
GPT-4-32k (extended): up to 32,768 tokens (about 25,000 words) if using the extended model (available to some Plus/Enterprise users​

When enabled, the assistant may bring in details from previous sessions (e.g., remembering a nickname, past advice given, etc.). Note: This doesn’t mean it loads entire chats into context, but it extracts key points and uses them. If disabled, each chat remains isolated aside from custom instructions.
File Uploads (Advanced Data Analysis):

Practical processing limit: Due to context size, ChatGPT will typically only read the first ~1000 lines of a text file per upload (approx on the order of 50-100k characters, depending on line length​

】. If a file is longer, it’s advisable to split it or ensure the important content is at the top. The assistant might summarize or skip the rest.
Retention: Uploaded content still has to fit in the working memory. If you upload a lot and then continue a long conversation, earlier file info may be “forgotten” unless reintroduce​

】. Summarizing and feeding back in is a strategy to mitigate this.
Supported file types: All common text formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, etc.), spreadsheets, JSON/CSV, and images for analysis. Code Interpreter can also handle images (for analysis, not generation) and various data files.
Image Input (Vision) via GPT-4: Users can give images to GPT-4 (if enabled). The model can analyze images (describe them, read text via OCR, etc.). There’s a size limit (~<4 MB per image often, and certain resolution limits). The exact limit isn’t published, but anecdotal usage suggests large images are downscaled. For AiUi design: image inputs can be a source of context (e.g., user uploads a photo of notes, AiUi can read it). Image outputs directly from GPT-4 are not possible (the model can only describe or analyze images, not create them) – for creation, one would use DALL·E or another dedicated tool.
Response Length Limits: While the model can output up to the full context window minus input tokens, the UI sometimes has an implicit cap on how much it will generate in one go (to avoid extremely long answers taking too long or costing too much). Practically, GPT-4 can usually return about ~1000 tokens worth of answer without issues, sometimes more. If an answer is extremely long, the model may stop and await user prompt to continue. AiUi’s deep dive mode should ideally break long answers into parts or ask if the user wants more detail rather than hitting an unseen limit.
Knowledge Cutoff and Accuracy: As of 2025, GPT-4’s knowledge cutoff is Sept 2021 (with limited 2023 knowledge in a later update, and browsing can fetch newer info). It won’t know events after that unless provided via user input or web browsing plugin. Any use of AiUi for up-to-date facts should involve the browsing plugin or user-supplied data. This is not a “limit” per se of AiUi’s design, but a model limitation to be aware of.
Multimodal Outputs: The ChatGPT UI can display:
Formatted text (with Markdown rendering),
LaTeX (for math),
Code blocks (with syntax highlighting but no execution unless using code mode),
Images (if the assistant provides an image via code tool or if an image link is rendered via the plugin mechanism). By default, the assistant cannot just decide to show an image – it must be via a tool or by the user uploading one. AiUi therefore primarily focuses on textual presentation.
No native support yet for clickable collapsible sections or buttons in answers (aside from the code run button). All interaction is via text.
Safety Filters: The system will refuse or safe-complete requests that violate content policy (hate, self-harm, violence, etc.). If AiUi is asked to do something disallowed, it should produce a refusal message. Also, excessive personal info in Memory might be filtered (OpenAI says sensitive personal data is handled carefully and not remembered unless user insists​

】. Users should avoid putting passwords or highly sensitive data into the chats since the system doesn’t guarantee perfect secrecy (though Enterprise has data encryption and no training on your data promises).
Latency: GPT-4 responses can be slower (several seconds for a medium reply, longer for very large ones) compared to GPT-3.5 which is faster. If AiUi is producing very large structured outputs (like code or big tables), the user might see the message stream typing out for a while. In practice, this is just a UX consideration – perhaps AiUi can warn “This might take a moment…” if a particularly heavy task is triggered (like analyzing a big file or doing a deep dive). But generally, for text answers it’s fine.
Extensibility (Plugins/Tools): With the plugin ecosystem, AiUi can be extended. For example:
Web Browsing plugin: AiUi can fetch current information or verify facts​

Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis): AiUi can run Python for calculations or data viz. The file size limits above (512MB, etc.) apply here. Execution time is limited (~120 seconds per run and some memory cap).
Third-party plugins: e.g., a plugin for Todo lists or WolframAlpha for math, etc. If integrated, AiUi could use them (with user permission) to enhance responses (like creating a calendar event from the plan, or doing precise math).
Token Counting Tips: 1 token is roughly ¾ of a word. For planning, note that 8192 tokens ~ about 5MB of text. The new 2M token file limit is huge (~ maybe 1.5 billion characters), but the model won’t literally hold that – it’s just for analysis chunking. Always consider summarizing large data.
Memory Persistence Details: If you use the “Save custom instruction as memory” feature or tell ChatGPT “Remember XYZ”, it will store that under your account’s memory. You can view and edit these in settings when memory is on. These count toward that global context usage (they effectively prepend to each new conversation). For example, if you have 500 tokens of saved memory, it uses that part of context alway】. AiUi’s user profile in custom instructions overlaps with this concept – one might use either or both. Just be mindful not to overload the model with redundant info in memory vs. custom instruction (they serve similar roles; custom instructions are essentially the initial memory).
This appendix provides a quick factual grounding. For instance, if someone asks “Can I upload a 100MB PDF?” – yes (100MB < 512MB​

】. “Will ChatGPT remember an entire book I paste?” – likely not all, because of context size (~8k–32k tokens) so summarization is needed. “How many modes can I add?” – no hard limit, as long as the instructions fit in 1500 chars and the model can distinguish them. “If I want the AI to generate an image of a chart, can it?” – not directly, but via Code Interpreter it can (thus within AiUi’s scope if that tool is allowed). Having these data points at hand can help in planning how to interact with AiUi (e.g., splitting files, knowing when to start a fresh chat to clear context, etc.) and in understanding the boundaries of the system’s memory and formatting capabilities.
Conclusion: By combining a clear understanding of OpenAI’s platform constraints with a forward-looking design (modes, memory use, formatting, emotional intelligence), AiUi offers a versatile blueprint for human–AI chat interactions. It is at once practical – leveraging the strengths of current ChatGPT technology – and aspirational, anticipating near-term advancements like richer memory and interactive outputs. With AiUi’s modular architecture, users can shape their AI assistant to their needs: one moment a quick fact-fetcher, next a deep brainstorming partner, next a compassionate coach – all while maintaining continuity and coherence across those roles. This design ultimately empowers users to get more out of AI conversations, making them more efficient, personalized, and intuitively interactive.
