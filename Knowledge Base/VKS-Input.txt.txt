VKS-Input.txt



Steps:
Keyword Detection: I identify key elements of the style. In VKS, this would include terms like "dynamic lines," "anatomical structure," "texture," and "light interaction."
Contextual Understanding: I interpret your request based on the overall context of the conversation (e.g., humanoid figures, creatures, abstract representations) to tailor the image accordingly.


1. Purpose of Input
The Input file provides the initial commands and prompts necessary for generating VKS-style images. It sets up the primary elements (dynamic lines, anatomy, light, and texture) and communicates the essential visual details that drive the style’s artistic intent.

2. Input Structure Overview
When generating images using DALL-E, input precision is critical to achieve accurate results. For the VKS style, input should include:

Clear descriptions of movement and energy, to guide the AI toward dynamic compositions.
Detailed visual characteristics of anatomy, light, and texture based on VKS principles.
Contextual information (e.g., setting, mood) to give the image a coherent and holistic feeling.
3. Guidelines for VKS Inputs
a. Specify Movement in Detail
VKS emphasizes dynamic lines and fluid motion. For effective input:

Use words like "flowing," "energetic," "curved," and "motion-filled" to describe how the lines should shape the figure.
Always emphasize motion, even for static poses. For example, input could be:
“A humanoid figure in motion, arms outstretched, with flowing lines capturing movement.”
b. Define Anatomy & Structure
Anatomy in VKS must be both expressive and grounded in reality:

Clearly state the proportions and exaggerations needed for each figure, emphasizing muscle groups or skeletal features.
For instance: “The figure’s muscles are exaggerated, emphasizing strength, with a skeletal form showing beneath the skin.”
c. Light and Shadow as Enhancers
Light and shadow must emphasize motion and texture in VKS:

Describe the source and intensity of light. Use terms like "gradients," "shadows," and "reflected light."
Example: “Soft, directional light from the right highlights the figure’s muscles, with deep shadows under the arms.”
d. Texture
Texture plays a key role in differentiating materials in VKS:

Specify texture with terms like “rough,” “smooth,” “cross-hatched,” or “organic.”
Example: “The figure’s skin is cross-hatched, resembling reptilian scales, with reflective highlights.”
4. Sample Input for VKS
"Create an image of a humanoid reptile figure using flowing, curved lines that emphasize movement. The figure’s muscles are exaggerated, with cross-hatching simulating scales. Light from the right casts deep shadows, accentuating the figure's form."
This input gives precise guidance for the AI to follow, combining detailed elements from VKS with proven strategies from successful DALL-E image generation practices.

5. Feedback Loop for Refinement
Include iterative feedback to improve image quality:

If the initial image lacks detail, refine the input to be more specific.
Continuously compare output to VKS principles, tweaking aspects like texture or anatomy as necessary.
