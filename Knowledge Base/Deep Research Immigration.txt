Deep Research: Immigration: 

Excellent. I will conduct deep research based on your detailed outline and enhancements. The research will focus on fact-checking right-wing narratives surrounding immigration, border security, and welfare, using verified government data, academic studies, and economic analysis. Additionally, I will incorporate historical context, corporate influence, and global comparisons to provide a well-rounded rebuttal against misinformation.

I will compile my findings into a structured report, including myth vs. fact comparisons, statistical trends, and insights into media manipulation and political strategies. I’ll notify you once the research is complete.

# Debunking Myths on Immigration, Border Security, and Welfare: A Fact-Checked Analysis

## Introduction  
Immigration and welfare policies are often shrouded in myths and fearmongering. Right-wing narratives frequently claim that immigrants bring crime, steal jobs, and drain public benefits, while simultaneously defending massive corporate subsidies and bailouts. This report conducts deep research to **fact-check and expose common fallacies** about immigration, border security, and welfare. Drawing on official government data, reputable research (Pew, Brookings, Cato, etc.), and historical records, we compare economic, social, and historical evidence to determine the real impacts of immigration and government assistance. The goal is to arm readers with facts and well-documented rebuttals to misinformation, separating **myths vs. facts** and highlighting how political actors manipulate these issues. We also explore the historical context of U.S. immigration, global comparisons, and potential policy solutions that address real problems rather than scapegoating vulnerable groups.

## 1. Immigration & Border Security: Myths vs. Facts

**Myth: “There’s an open-border crisis and a flood of illegal crossings.”**  
**Fact:** While undocumented border crossings have increased in recent years, the situation is more complex than political soundbites suggest. U.S. Border Patrol *“encounters”* (apprehensions plus immediate expulsions) at the southwest border did hit record levels around 2.2 million in FY2022 ([CBP Enforcement Statistics Fiscal Year 2023 | U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics-fy2023#:~:text=Office%20of%20Field%20Operations%20,859%2C501%20405%2C036%201%2C662%2C167%202%2C214%2C652%202%2C063%2C692)). However, a significant number are repeat crossers – due in part to the pandemic-era **Title 42** policy that rapidly expelled migrants without formal deportation, prompting many to try again. This inflated raw crossing numbers without indicating unique individuals. Historically, the U.S. saw even higher crossings in the past; apprehensions peaked at 1.64 million in the year 2000 ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=Brown%E2%80%99s%20office%20cited%20U,just%20under%20264%2C000%20in%201971)) ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=Arrest%20totals%20along%20the%20Southern,64%20million%20in%202000)). By 2017, border apprehensions had actually fallen to their lowest point since the early 1970s ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=In%20April%2C%20we%20rated%20%E2%80%98True%2C%E2%80%99,been%20in%20nearly%2050%20years)). In other words, today’s “crisis” needs context: **the border is not literally open**, and enforcement is robust (the Border Patrol now has over 19,000 agents and billions in technology). Moreover, nearly **half of undocumented immigrants didn’t sneak in at all** – they entered legally on visas and then overstayed ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=That%20report%20estimated%20visa%20overstays,that%20year)) ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=We%20asked%20Nowrasteh%20whether%20that,still%20holds%20true%20in%202018)). A recent analysis found about *42%* of the undocumented population are visa overstayers, and about *two-thirds of new* unauthorized immigrants in a recent year came from visa overstays rather than border crossings ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=That%20report%20estimated%20visa%20overstays,that%20year)). This undercuts the argument that a border wall or more guards alone would “solve” illegal immigration. 

**Myth: “Immigrants are bringing a crime wave across the border.”**  
**Fact:** Comprehensive data show that immigrants (including undocumented immigrants) have *lower crime and incarceration rates* than native-born Americans. For example, a detailed study of Texas (one of the few states that records criminal convictions by immigration status) found that over 2013–2022 the homicide conviction rate for **illegal immigrants was 2.2 per 100,000** people – *significantly lower* than the rate of 3.0 per 100,000 for native-born Americans ([New Cato Research Shows That Illegal Immigrants Are Less Likely to Be Convicted of Murder in Texas | Cato at Liberty Blog](https://www.cato.org/blog/new-cato-research-shows-illegal-immigrants-are-less-likely-be-convicted-murder-texas#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20Cato%20Institute,2%20per%20100%2C000%20legal%20immigrants)). In that period, illegal immigrants in Texas were **26% less likely** to be convicted of homicide than natives, and legal immigrants were 61% less likely ([New Cato Research Shows That Illegal Immigrants Are Less Likely to Be Convicted of Murder in Texas | Cato at Liberty Blog](https://www.cato.org/blog/new-cato-research-shows-illegal-immigrants-are-less-likely-be-convicted-murder-texas#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20Cato%20Institute,2%20per%20100%2C000%20legal%20immigrants)). This “Texas study” aligns with nationwide research: immigrant communities tend to have lower crime rates. Far from a wave of cartel criminals, the typical undocumented border-crosser is a family fleeing violence or a worker seeking jobs, not a felon. The **fear of immigrant crime is largely a political fabrication**. Even the presence of would-be terrorists at the border is exceedingly rare – in recent data, only about *0.008%* of Border Patrol encounters involved anyone on the terrorism watchlist ([CBP Enforcement Statistics Fiscal Year 2023 | U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics-fy2023#:~:text=Percentage%20of%20Total%20USBP%20Encounters,0.0083)). The vast majority of people caught crossing are simply economic migrants or asylum seekers with no criminal record. Scapegoating immigrants for crime is an old nativist tactic unsupported by facts.

**Myth: “They steal American jobs and drive down wages.”**  
**Fact:** Immigrants do participate in the labor market, but they also *grow the economy* and often fill vital jobs that are hard to staff. Undocumented immigrants make up about 5% of the U.S. workforce and are heavily concentrated in industries like agriculture, construction, food service, and caregiving ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=estimates%20that%20about%201,undocumented%20immigrants%20on%20Social%20Security)) ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=Ironically%2C%20a%20piece%20of%20legislation,their%20employers%20when%20asked%20for)). These are sectors where employers often struggle to hire enough workers. Multiple economic studies (including a landmark National Academy of Sciences report) have found **little to no long-term negative impact on average wages or unemployment for native-born workers**. If there is an effect, it tends to be a very small dip in wages for prior immigrants or workers without a high school diploma, while most other groups see neutral or slight positive effects due to overall economic expansion. Immigrants also have higher rates of entrepreneurship, starting about 25% of new businesses in the U.S. despite being 14% of the population. They create jobs. Moreover, the notion of a fixed number of jobs (“they take jobs we need”) is a fallacy – economies are dynamic, and immigrants often **complement** native workers’ skills rather than substitute for them. For instance, immigrant farmworkers or care aides enable higher-skilled Americans to remain in the labor force. Areas that have cracked down on undocumented labor often faced *labor shortages and even crop losses* (e.g. farms in states with harsh immigration laws reported crops rotting due to lack of workers). Even under “America First” immigration restrictions, businesses have warned of worker shortages that **drive up prices** and hurt the economy ([Which industries are most vulnerable to Trump's immigration ...](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-immigration-inflation-economy/#:~:text=Which%20industries%20are%20most%20vulnerable,by%20shrinking%20the%20nation%27s)). Simply put, immigrants contribute labor and talent that boosts U.S. productivity. Fears of mass job displacement are not supported by economic data.

**Myth: “Immigrants don’t pay taxes and just strain the system.”**  
**Fact:** Immigrants – including those here illegally – pay a wide variety of taxes, often supporting public coffers **more than they draw benefits** (since undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for those benefits). Undocumented workers pay billions in **payroll taxes** each year for Social Security and Medicare that they cannot later reclaim. In fact, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary estimated that **undocumented immigrants contributed a net $12 billion to Social Security in 2010 alone** ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=estimates%20that%20about%201,undocumented%20immigrants%20on%20Social%20Security)). That year, unauthorized workers paid about **$13 billion** into the Social Security trust fund while only about $1 billion in benefits were paid out on their behalf ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=estimates%20that%20about%201,undocumented%20immigrants%20on%20Social%20Security)). Those excess billions bolster the retirement system for American seniors ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=estimates%20that%20about%201,undocumented%20immigrants%20on%20Social%20Security)). Additionally, immigrants pay sales taxes, property taxes (directly or via rent), and income taxes (many undocumented immigrants do file income tax returns using IRS-issued ITINs, and others have taxes withheld under false SSNs). A 2017 analysis found undocumented immigrants pay an estimated **$11.6 billion in state and local taxes** annually ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=The%20Truth%20About%20Undocumented%20Immigrants,Not%20all)) ([How much do undocumented immigrants pay in taxes? - PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/02/maria-teresa-kumar/how-much-do-undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/#:~:text=How%20much%20do%20undocumented%20immigrants,percent%20of%20their%20total%20income)). On the flip side, **undocumented immigrants are barred from virtually all federal welfare programs** (we detail this in Section 3). Far from freeloading, most immigrants are net contributors, often **subsidizing public programs** that U.S. citizens rely on. It’s also worth noting that *legal* immigrants often arrive educated at another country’s expense (think of engineers from India or doctors from abroad), effectively a “brain gain” for the U.S. economy. The broad consensus of economists is that immigration, on balance, increases GDP growth and has a positive fiscal impact over the long run ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=Immigrants%20built%20the%20United%20States,in%20the%20labor%20market%20and)) ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=of%20immigration%20would%20enhance%20economic,S)), especially when immigrants’ children’s upward mobility is factored in. Immigrants also offset demographic challenges: as the native workforce ages and birth rates decline, young immigrant workers help support the labor force and tax base ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=of%20immigration%20would%20enhance%20economic,S)).

**Myth: “They should just immigrate legally like my ancestors did – today’s immigrants break the law.”**  
**Fact:** It’s *far harder to “get in line” and come legally today* than it was for earlier generations. The U.S. immigration system has strict numerical caps and backlogs that can stretch decades. For example, a U.S. citizen trying to sponsor a brother from the Philippines faces a **wait of 20+ years** due to annual visa quotas. Employment-based green cards are capped at about 140,000 per year for the entire world, with per-country limits that mean, say, an Indian PhD working here might wait over a decade for a visa because of the country quota. The oft-cited advice to “come the right way” ignores **reality**: for many hardworking people with no immediate family in the U.S. or highly-specialized skills, there *is no legal pathway at all*. Refugee and asylum slots are limited and backlogged as well. By contrast, 100 years ago the U.S. had virtually no numerical limits on European immigration – your ancestors simply showed up at Ellis Island and, if deemed not carrying disease, were admitted. Immigration law has become much more restrictive since the 1920s (when the first quotas were imposed), and especially after 1965 when for the first time caps were applied to the Western Hemisphere. This means many migrants coming from Latin America or Africa today **have no viable legal avenues**, no matter how desperate their situation, unless U.S. policy changes. It’s important to note many *do* try to immigrate legally: the U.S. issues about 1 million green cards yearly (mostly to family of citizens and refugees) and hundreds of thousands of temporary work visas. But these numbers don’t always meet labor demand or humanitarian need. Other countries have different approaches – for instance, **Canada and Australia use “points” systems** favoring skilled immigrants and take in **much higher immigrants per capita** than the U.S. (Canada’s intake is roughly 3× higher per capita) ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=finds%20that%20U,United%20States%20in%20addressing%20the)) ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=been%20cited%20by%20some%20in,advanced%20economies%20to%20determine%20which)). The comparison shows that the U.S. could admit more immigrants through legal channels to reduce pressure on the border. In short, many undocumented immigrants *would* immigrate legally if they could – but our laws offer them **no line to stand in**. This legal bottleneck contributes to unauthorized immigration. A more sensible system (as discussed in Solutions) would expand legal work visas and refugee slots so that fewer people feel forced to cross illegally. 

**Myth: “Mass immigration is an unprecedented threat”** (implying the U.S. has never seen immigration like this before).  
**Fact:** The U.S. is a nation built by immigrants, and current immigration levels (legal plus illegal) are not without historical parallel. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population reached similar levels as today (~13-15%). Around 1900, cities teemed with newcomers from Italy, Poland, Ireland, etc., much like the diverse immigrant communities now. Those earlier waves were likewise met with panic and xenophobia (which we’ll see in the historical section), yet they and their descendants integrated into American society. Today’s immigrants are learning English at similar rates by the second generation, and **naturalization rates** are high (millions of immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens each decade). The idea that today’s immigration is uniquely dire is a historical misconception – America has absorbed large immigrant influxes before and ultimately benefited from them. What *is* different now is the **politicization** of immigration (discussed later) and the fact that contemporary immigrants are more likely to be non-European (coming from Latin America, Asia, Africa), which has unfortunately activated a strain of racialized fear in some political rhetoric. But by the numbers, immigration is not spiraling out of control: as a proportion of population, countries like Canada, Australia, and many European nations actually **accept more immigrants than the U.S.** and manage it successfully ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=finds%20that%20U,processing%20business%20visas%20than%20the)) ([US Immigration Policy Lessons From Canada and Australia July 2023](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/US-ImmigrationPolicyLessonsFromCanadaandAustraliaJuly2023.pdf#:~:text=aging%20populations,advanced%20economies%20to%20determine%20which)). With smart policy, immigration can continue to be a source of vitality for the U.S., not a “threat.”

## 2. A Historical Perspective: Immigration Has Always Been Politicized

**Immigration is not a new political battleground** – it has been a contentious issue throughout U.S. history, often entangled with racism and economic anxiety. Understanding this history reveals a repeating pattern: each new wave of immigrants has been **scapegoated for society’s problems**, only for those fears to later be proven unfounded. Here’s a brief timeline and historical context:

- **Open Doors and Early Restrictions (1776–1880s):** For the first century of the republic, the U.S. had virtually **open borders for Europeans**. The very first immigration law, in 1790, restricted naturalized citizenship to “free white persons,” excluding enslaved people and nonwhites ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Nationality%20Act%20of%201790)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20law,%E2%80%9D)). By the mid-1800s, large numbers of Irish and German immigrants arrived, escaping famine and revolution. This triggered one of the first nativist backlashes: the **Know-Nothing Party** of the 1850s railed against Catholic immigrants (Irish, Germans) as un-American. Anti-immigrant publications in 1854 warned that “**alien foreigners will prove ruinous to American workingmen, by reducing the wages of labor**” ([Handout 2.4](https://www.uua.org/files/documents/washingtonoffice/immigration/studyguides/handout2.4.pdf#:~:text=4,We%20do%20not)) – language eerily similar to modern claims. Yet these immigrant groups eventually assimilated and became part of the American fabric. The *first federal immigrant exclusion* targeted Asian migrants: the **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882** outright banned Chinese laborers from entry and denied them citizenship ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=relating%20to%20Chinese%E2%80%9D)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=This%20law%20was%20a%20major,entry%20and%20ineligibility%20for%20citizenship)). This law was explicitly race-based and came after years of West Coast agitation that Chinese workers were “taking” jobs and depressing wages (even though they mostly did backbreaking railroad and mining work). The Chinese Exclusion Act was a “major shift toward growing restrictiveness” in U.S. policy ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=relating%20to%20Chinese%E2%80%9D)) – it set a precedent for excluding groups based on nationality and race.

- **The Quota Era (1920s–1965):** Nativist sentiment spiked after World War I. Fears of radicals and the desire to preserve a white Anglo-Saxon majority led to the **Immigration Act of 1924 (Johnson-Reed Act)**, which imposed harsh quotas. This law set **national-origin quotas** that favored immigrants from Northern/Western Europe and almost **shut out Asians and Southern/Eastern Europeans** ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Immigration%20Act%20of%201924%20%28Johnson,Act)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=To%20further%20limit%20immigration%2C%20this,the%20United%20States%20until%201965)). For example, Italy’s annual quota was a few thousand, compared to much larger allowances for Britain. These quotas – blatantly discriminatory – stayed in place until 1965. During the Great Depression, immigrants (especially Mexicans) were blamed for job scarcity. In an episode of extreme scapegoating, authorities conducted the **Mexican Repatriation (1929–1936)**, forcibly deporting an estimated **400,000 to 1 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans**, including U.S. citizen children, to Mexico ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Mexican%20Repatriation%20%281929)). This was a dark chapter where people of Mexican heritage were made into scapegoats for economic woes. Similarly, in the 1880s–1910s, popular media and politicians regularly disparaged new immigrants – *Italians* were stereotyped as criminals, *Jews* as anarchists, *Irish* as drunks. A quote from 1834 by a prominent preacher Lyman Beecher sounds like a modern demagogue: he decried the influx of “pauper emigrants” **“filling our prisons, and crowding our poor-houses, and quadrupling our taxation”** ([Handout 2.4](https://www.uua.org/files/documents/washingtonoffice/immigration/studyguides/handout2.4.pdf#:~:text=justice%20of%20Supreme%20Court%2C%20regarding,lay%20their%20inexperienced%20hand%20upon)). The irony is that each of these groups eventually proved those fears wrong; crime did not soar because of Italian or Irish immigration, and they contributed greatly to America. The role of the **media** in these eras was significant: newspapers would run xenophobic cartoons and editorials. For instance, in the late 1800s, *Harper’s Weekly* and other outlets portrayed Chinese immigrants as sinister or Irish as violent apes. Media-fueled hysteria is not new – it’s a longstanding tool in anti-immigrant politics.

- **1965 and After: Civil Rights and New Waves:** The civil rights movement brought a reform of racist immigration laws. The **Hart-Celler Act of 1965** ended the national origins quota system, opening the door to immigrants from all regions (Asia, Latin America, Africa) under a new preference system (family reunification and skilled employment) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Immigration%20and%20Nationality%20Act%20of,Celler%20Act)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=This%20law%20set%20the%20main,immigration%20from%20the%20within%20Americas)). This was a turning point: America became more **diverse** in its immigrant origins. In the 1970s–80s, we saw refugees admitted from Vietnam, Cambodia, and elsewhere (Refugee Act of 1980 set up a formal refugee admissions process ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Refugee%20Act%20of%201980)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=While%20adhering%20to%20the%20UN,Congress%20and%20the%20White%20House))). Notably, as immigration from Latin America grew (partly due to the 1965 law capping Western Hemisphere immigration for the first time), illegal immigration also grew because **demand for visas outstripped supply**. In 1986, President Reagan signed the **Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)**, a bipartisan law that granted amnesty to about 3 million undocumented immigrants and promised tougher enforcement (including employer sanctions) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Immigration%20Reform%20and%20Control%20Act,1986)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=To%20address%20the%20problem%20of,and%20expanded%20guestworker%20visa%20programs)). IRCA was an example of a grand bargain – legalize immigrants who had put down roots in exchange for future prevention – but the enforcement (employer checks) proved porous and new unauthorized immigrants kept coming to fill U.S. labor needs.

- **Modern Politicization (1990s–Present):** Immigration became an intensely partisan issue in the late 20th century. In 1994, California’s Proposition 187 (backed by Republicans) sought to bar undocumented immigrants from public services; it passed but was later struck down. The 1996 laws (IIRIRA and welfare reform) made legal immigration more difficult and introduced a 5-year ban on new immigrants accessing federal benefits ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Illegal%20Immigration%20Reform%20and%20Immigrant,1996)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Building%20on%20the%20steps%20taken,for%20verification%20of%20employment%20credentials)), reflecting a growing narrative that immigrants were a burden. After 9/11 (2001), immigration got tangled with national security fears – the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 to house immigration enforcement ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=2002)) ([Timeline - Immigration History](https://immigrationhistory.org/timeline/#:~:text=Enhanced%20Border%20Security%20and%20Visa,2002)), and policies grew stricter on visas and border security. **When did immigration become so politicized?** One could argue it has always been, but it truly became a **wedge issue** in the late 20th century, exploited in campaign ads and cable news. By the 2010s, figures like Donald Trump rose to political prominence by stoking fears of immigrants (calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and criminals in his 2015 campaign announcement, for example). This rhetoric has antecedents: in 1892 an Irish-American labor leader railed against Chinese workers and even suggested building a figurative wall to keep them out ([Handout 2.4](https://www.uua.org/files/documents/washingtonoffice/immigration/studyguides/handout2.4.pdf#:~:text=the%20Philadelphia%20Sun%2C%201854%205,We%20do%20not)). Indeed, the idea of a border wall was floated long before Trump – **in 1750**, Ben Franklin fretted about German immigrants in Pennsylvania and John Jay suggested building *“a wall of brass around the country”* to keep out Catholics ([Handout 2.4](https://www.uua.org/files/documents/washingtonoffice/immigration/studyguides/handout2.4.pdf#:~:text=1,regarding%20%E2%80%9CCatholic%20alien%20invaders%2C%E2%80%9D%201750s)). The language of invasion and cultural ruin has been recycled in each era. What’s different now is the scale of media amplification (24/7 news and social media spreading fear) and the fusion of anti-immigrant sentiment with party identity. By the 2010s, one major party made opposing immigration a core issue, often at odds with factual economic need or humanitarian values. Importantly, **scapegoating specific groups** has recurred: in different eras it was the Irish, Chinese, Italians, Jews, and today it might be Latino or Muslim immigrants. But the pattern is the same – blaming immigrants for crime, disease, or economic trouble. History teaches us that these claims are often exaggerations or outright false, serving as convenient **political scapegoats** during times of change or anxiety.

- **Media’s Role Over Time:** From xenophobic pamphlets and cartoons a century ago to primetime TV and Facebook memes now, media has always shaped public perception of immigrants. Sensationalism sells. In the 1800s, newspapers published lurid tales of immigrant criminal gangs (e.g. the Irish “Five Points” gangs in New York) that stoked fear. In modern times, certain cable networks run loops of migrant caravans and isolated crimes by undocumented people to create an impression of chaos. Academic studies have found that when media emphasizes immigrant crimes (even if rare), it fuels public support for harsher policies ([Private prison industry shifts focus to immigrant detention centers, funding immigration hawks • OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/#:~:text=Private%20prison%20interests%20boost%20pro,security%20politicians)) ([Private prison industry shifts focus to immigrant detention centers, funding immigration hawks • OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/#:~:text=The%20private%20prison%20industry%20directly,these%20zero%20tolerance%20immigration%20policies)). Conversely, positive or humanizing stories are less often told. Recognizing this helps us be skeptical of manipulated narratives. The media has at times also been an ally in countering myths – for example, major newspapers debunking the idea that immigrants bring disease or that they are more prone to terrorism. But partisan media often does the opposite, choosing fear over facts.

**Key Takeaway:** Immigration has *always* been politicized in America. Each new wave faced suspicion – yet America endured and thrived. The very arguments used against immigrants today (they won’t assimilate, they bring crime, they take jobs, they are undesirables) were used against groups like Germans in the 1750s ([Handout 2.4](https://www.uua.org/files/documents/washingtonoffice/immigration/studyguides/handout2.4.pdf#:~:text=1,regarding%20%E2%80%9CCatholic%20alien%20invaders%2C%E2%80%9D%201750s)), Irish in the 1850s, Chinese in the 1880s, Italians in the 1900s, etc. Each time, those groups proved to be productive Americans. Knowing this history is crucial: it reveals that **fear-based narratives are cyclical and often wrong**. It also shows that policy can swing from open to restrictive – and that heavily restricting immigration (as in the 1924–1965 quota period) was driven by racial bias and had lasting consequences (e.g. it limited refuge for Jews during WWII, who were turned away due to quotas). Immigration became a culture-war issue in recent decades not because facts changed, but because it’s an effective way to mobilize voters by appealing to identity and fear of change. In the next sections, we’ll see how similar manipulation occurs around **welfare and economics**, and how corporate interests and politics intersect with immigration.

## 3. Welfare & Economic Realities: Cutting Through the Myths

Public assistance programs (often derisively labeled “welfare”) are another arena rife with misconceptions. Right-wing talking points paint a picture of **lazy moochers, rampant fraud, and immigrants draining the system**. Let’s examine the reality with data:

**Myth: “Welfare recipients are mostly able-bodied people who won’t work, and largely immigrants or minorities.”**  
**Fact:** The majority of people who receive means-tested benefits in the U.S. are **children, elderly, or working poor – and overwhelmingly U.S. citizens**. According to the Census Bureau, in an average month tens of millions of Americans use programs like Medicaid, SNAP (food stamps), or TANF cash assistance. Who are they? About **1 in 3 children** in America is covered by Medicaid or CHIP, and millions of low-income workers use SNAP to supplement wages. The largest group of SNAP beneficiaries, for instance, is **white Americans** (by raw numbers, though minorities are represented disproportionately to their share of the population due to higher poverty rates). Overall, **90%+ of major benefit program recipients are U.S. citizens**. Non-citizens (including legal immigrants) make up a small fraction, and *undocumented immigrants are not eligible at all for these programs*. Far from being “mostly unemployed,” a large share of adult Medicaid and SNAP recipients are **employed** – they just earn so little that they still qualify for help. For example, many Walmart and McDonald’s employees rely on food stamps and Medicaid; a recent list of top employers of SNAP/Medicaid recipients included those companies ([Walmart and McDonald's among top employers of Medicaid ... - CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/walmart-and-mcdonalds-among-top-employers-of-medicaid-and-food-stamp-beneficiaries.html#:~:text=Walmart%20and%20McDonald%27s%20among%20top,stamps%2C%20according%20to%20a%20study)). The image of the “welfare queen” driving a Cadillac (a racist trope dating to the Reagan era) is a myth. In truth, benefits are modest and targeted to the vulnerable. Even **able-bodied adults without dependents** face strict time limits and work requirements on SNAP (only 3 months of benefits in 3 years if they aren’t working) ([What the data says about food stamps in the U.S.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/19/what-the-data-says-about-food-stamps-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=What%20the%20data%20says%20about,recently%2C%20this%20additional%20work)) ([What the data says about food stamps in the U.S. | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/19/what-the-data-says-about-food-stamps-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=,food%20stamps)). Most full-time workers do not qualify for means-tested aid at all (unless their families are large or wages extremely low), and those who work part-time or gig jobs often cycle on and off assistance as their income fluctuates. 

**Myth: “Illegal immigrants get welfare and public benefits for free.”**  
**Fact:** Undocumented immigrants are **ineligible** for virtually all federal welfare programs by law ([Do Undocumented Immigrants Overuse Government Benefits? | Econofact](https://econofact.org/do-undocumented-immigrants-overuse-government-benefits#:~:text=,emergency%20Medicaid%2C%20the)). They cannot get TANF (cash assistance), food stamps (SNAP), Medicaid (except emergency care in a hospital), or public housing. They are even barred from Obamacare health insurance exchanges ([Do Undocumented Immigrants Overuse Government Benefits? | Econofact](https://econofact.org/do-undocumented-immigrants-overuse-government-benefits#:~:text=review%29,their%20employer%20or%20on%20the)). The only public benefits they might access are emergency services or sometimes state/local programs like emergency disaster relief, or schooling for their children (K-12 public education is available to all kids per a 1982 Supreme Court ruling). Some U.S.-born children of undocumented parents do receive benefits **because the children are U.S. citizens**. In those cases, the assistance (say, food stamps or WIC nutrition) is calculated for the citizen children only, not the undocumented parent. Nativist commentators often conflate this and claim “immigrants are on welfare,” when in reality it’s American kids getting needed support. Studies confirm that **immigrant-headed households (legal or not)** use means-tested benefits at *lower rates* than comparable native households – partly due to eligibility rules and partly fear of jeopardizing immigration status ([Do Undocumented Immigrants Overuse Government Benefits? | Econofact](https://econofact.org/do-undocumented-immigrants-overuse-government-benefits#:~:text=the%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20or,to%20receive%20Social%20Security%20benefits)). A Cato Institute study noted that low-income non-citizens have **lower participation in safety net programs than low-income citizens**, debunking the notion of disproportionate immigrant use ([Do Undocumented Immigrants Overuse Government Benefits? | Econofact](https://econofact.org/do-undocumented-immigrants-overuse-government-benefits#:~:text=the%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20or,to%20receive%20Social%20Security%20benefits)). Even legal permanent residents (green card holders) face a 5-year bar before they can access federal benefits (a restriction from the 1996 welfare reform). The bottom line: if someone is undocumented, they’re **paying into** safety net programs via taxes (as discussed, billions in taxes) but generally **cannot take out**. So the argument that they burden welfare is false – if anything, they subsidize it.

**Myth: “The welfare system is riddled with fraud and abuse.”**  
**Fact:** Fraud exists but is *exceptionally low* in major programs, and certainly nowhere near the scale of corporate tax evasion or other drains on public funds. For instance, the SNAP (food stamp) program has an **improper payment rate** around 6% (which includes mistakes and underpayments, not just overpayments) and the specific **fraud (trafficking) rate is about 1.5%** ([[PDF] SNAP “Program Integrity” | CLASP](https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022_SNAP20Program20Integrity20-20How20Racialized20Fraud20Provisions20Criminalize20Hunger.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20SNAP%20%E2%80%9CProgram%20Integrity%E2%80%9D%20,7)). According to the USDA, about 1 cent of every SNAP dollar is trafficked (exchanged for cash) – a historically low rate ([[PDF] SNAP “Program Integrity” | CLASP](https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022_SNAP20Program20Integrity20-20How20Racialized20Fraud20Provisions20Criminalize20Hunger.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20SNAP%20%E2%80%9CProgram%20Integrity%E2%80%9D%20,7)), thanks to electronic benefit cards and oversight. TANF cash assistance fraud is also relatively rare; states have many verification rules. High-profile “welfare queen” cases are exceedingly uncommon and often exaggerated in political rhetoric. In fact, audits often find that **the vast majority of recipients follow the rules**. The idea of widespread abuse has been used to justify cutting benefits, but evidence shows most beneficiaries are truly needy and use benefits for basic expenses. Compare this to, say, **tax fraud by wealthy individuals and corporations**, which amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars (tax gap) – far eclipsing any welfare leakage. The narrative fixates on a poor person getting a few extra dollars they shouldn’t, while ignoring far larger issues. Moreover, government has beefed up program integrity: for example, *welfare offices run asset tests, income verification, work requirement tracking, etc.*, making it hard to scam the system for long. **Myth-busting example:** A PBS analysis noted that about **two-thirds of Americans will use a welfare program at least once in their life for a short period** (often after a job loss or during early childhood) ([From Mothers' Pensions to Welfare Queens, Debunking Myths about ...](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/from-mothers-pensions-to-welfare-queens-debunking-myths-about-welfare/#:~:text=,least%20six%20months%2C%20sometime)). This indicates that welfare is more of a social insurance that most families turn to temporarily, rather than a permanent handout to a small “lazy” underclass. Cases of intergenerational long-term welfare dependency exist but are quite rare after reforms in the 1990s imposed time limits. In short, **welfare fraud is the exception, not the norm** ([[PDF] Welfare: Myth and Reality](https://incomesecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pay_the_Rent__Feed_the_Kids_-_Backgrounder_-_Welfare_Myth_and_Reality_-_2003.pdf#:~:text=,from%20the%20Ontario%20Provincial)), and focusing on it distracts from the positive impact these programs have in reducing poverty.

**Myth: “Once on welfare, people stay forever. It creates a culture of dependency.”**  
**Fact:** Most public assistance in the U.S. is **temporary or cyclical**, and many beneficiaries move on as their situation improves. For example, unemployment insurance typically lasts up to 6 months. TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) has a federal lifetime limit of 5 years, and many states enforce even shorter cumulative limits or work requirements ([[PDF] Work Requirements, Time Limits, and Work Incentives in TANF ...](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43400.pdf#:~:text=,months%20of%20federally%20funded%20TANF)) ([[PDF] Work Requirements, Time Limits, and Work Incentives in TANF ...](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43400.pdf#:~:text=Time%20Limit%20Policies,months%20of%20federally%20funded%20TANF)). SNAP enrollment expands during recessions and contracts when jobs are plentiful – demonstrating that people tend to use it when needed and leave when they can. According to the Census Bureau’s SIPP data, more than half of new SNAP recipients exit the program within a year as their income rises or their situation changes. Medicaid coverage also changes with circumstances (children may go on and off as parental income crosses thresholds). While there are certainly chronic poverty situations that require long-term aid (a disabled individual on SSI, for instance), those are a minority. The idea of generations lounging on welfare was more rhetoric than reality, especially after reforms. In fact, **caseloads for cash welfare (TANF) have plummeted** since 1996 – from 12 million recipients then to about 3 million today – not because poverty vanished, but because of program restrictions and the shift to in-work supports like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Many poor people today actually *don’t* get cash welfare at all. Instead, support is largely via **working-family assistance** (earned tax credits, child tax credit, etc.). If anything, the U.S. safety net is less generous and less “cushy” than other developed nations, which belies the dependency claim. For example, European countries with more robust welfare (and less stigma around it) often have *higher* rates of upward mobility and lower poverty, suggesting that temporary support helps people eventually thrive rather than trapping them. A comparative point: **Nordic countries** provide extensive benefits (universal healthcare, free education, housing support) and yet have high employment rates and innovative economies – strong safety nets did not create mass laziness. The U.S. ethos has always emphasized work, and indeed most welfare programs here are structured to encourage work (some require it). So the “lifetime moocher” narrative is largely a caricature.

**Myth: “Undeserving people (especially immigrants) are milking the welfare system, while we spend too much on these programs.”**  
**Fact:** Let’s put spending in perspective. The **vast majority of U.S. social spending goes to the elderly (Social Security, Medicare)**, which are earned benefits, not what we traditionally call “welfare.” When it comes to means-tested welfare programs for the poor (Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, housing aid, etc.), the total is substantial – roughly $1 trillion a year – but this must be measured against need. These programs lifted an estimated 37 million people out of poverty in 2018 (per the Supplemental Poverty Measure), including millions of children. Moreover, **immigrants are not a disproportionate drain**: as noted, undocumented folks can’t get benefits, and even legal immigrants have restricted access. Studies generally find immigrants *contribute more in taxes than they use in public benefits over the long run*, particularly when you include second-generation outcomes. Also, many welfare programs are temporary counter-cyclical supports – they swell during hard times (preventing things from getting worse) and shrink in good times. For instance, during the Great Recession and COVID-19 pandemic, food stamps and unemployment benefits expanded, which was *by design* to stabilize the economy. Politicians sometimes point to those peak spending moments to claim “explosion of welfare,” ignoring that it’s largely responsive to crises. It’s worth noting, too, that **corporate America quietly benefits from welfare**: low-wage employers in effect get subsidized labor because their workers’ basic needs are met partly by taxpayer-funded programs. A striking report found that Walmart’s low-paid employees cost taxpayers an estimated **$6.2 billion a year in public assistance** (food stamps, Medicaid, etc.) ([
	
	  Consumer Action - Walmart workers cost taxpayers $6.2 billion In public assistance
  
](https://www.consumer-action.org/news/articles/walmart_workers_cost_taxpayers_6.2_billion_in_public_assistance#:~:text=Walmart%E2%80%99s%20low,with%20Tax%20Day%2C%20April%2015)). In other words, the government (and taxpayers) are indirectly footing the bill that allows big companies to pay lower wages. If we raised the minimum wage or had stronger labor unions, more workers would earn enough to not need aid, thereby reducing welfare costs and shifting the burden back to private payrolls. So, rather than “freeloaders” on welfare, one could argue some **companies are freeloading on the safety net** to supplement skimpy pay. Far from being “undeserving,” many welfare recipients are in fact **the backbone of essential industries** – they are just underpaid.

**Myth: “The U.S. welfare system is overly generous, unlike other countries – it’s turning us into a socialist state.”**  
**Fact:** By international standards, the U.S. safety net is relatively stingy and targeted. The U.S. spends about **18-20% of GDP on social programs** (including Social Security and Medicare), whereas many Western European countries spend 25-30% ([Social spending - OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/social-spending.html#:~:text=At%20just%20over%2030,or%20more)). Programs like paid family leave, universal healthcare, or free college – common in other advanced nations – are absent or minimal here, meaning American families often have higher out-of-pocket costs and burdens. The result: the U.S. actually has a *higher poverty rate* and *lower economic mobility* than peer countries with more robust welfare states. For example, **child poverty in the U.S.** (even after accounting for welfare) has typically been higher than in Canada or Western Europe, in part because our benefits are less generous. The idea that our system is too generous simply doesn’t hold when, in reality, **many struggling Americans fall through the cracks**. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans live below the poverty line and many get little help; homelessness is a visible crisis in U.S. cities, often tied to the lack of social housing or mental health services. In contrast, countries with “big welfare states” often have far fewer people in extreme need. Thus, the trope that America is coddling people with an expansive welfare system is false – if anything, our system could better address basic needs, and evidence suggests that might improve overall outcomes (health, crime, productivity). 

To summarize, **welfare myths** are used to pit working people against each other – “makers” vs “takers” – but the truth is more nuanced. Most people who receive aid truly need it and use it temporarily. Immigrants are largely locked out of aid. Fraud is minimal, and many beneficiaries work in essential yet low-paid jobs. The narrative of widespread abuse is a political tool that distracts from larger issues like **wage stagnation, inequality, and the fact that we tolerate poverty in a rich nation**. In the next section, we turn the lens to **“corporate welfare”** and how that often escapes the scrutiny applied to social welfare.

## 4. Corporate Welfare & Government Bailouts: The Double Standard

While politicians rail against spending on poor families, they often ignore (or actively support) far greater sums of **taxpayer money flowing to corporations and the wealthy**. This is often termed *“corporate welfare.”* It includes subsidies, tax breaks, bailouts, and sweetheart deals that benefit companies or industries. Let’s explore this contrast:

- **Scale of Corporate Welfare:** According to estimates by the Cato Institute and others, federal subsidies to businesses cost U.S. taxpayers **around $100 billion each year** ([Welfare for the Well-Off: How Business Subsidies Fleece Taxpayers | Hoover Institution Welfare for the Well-Off: How Business Subsidies Fleece Taxpayers](https://www.hoover.org/research/welfare-well-how-business-subsidies-fleece-taxpayers#:~:text=Welfare%20for%20the%20Well,Business%20Subsidies%20Fleece%20Taxpayers)). This includes direct payments, grants, loan guarantees, and special tax credits for industries like agriculture, energy, and finance. For example, Big Agriculture receives billions in crop subsidies, and oil and gas companies enjoy tax advantages and subsidies for exploration. The **Hoover Institution** noted that eliminating these corporate subsidies could allow a 10% across-the-board income tax cut – that’s how much money is at stake ([Welfare for the Well-Off: How Business Subsidies Fleece Taxpayers | Hoover Institution Welfare for the Well-Off: How Business Subsidies Fleece Taxpayers](https://www.hoover.org/research/welfare-well-how-business-subsidies-fleece-taxpayers#:~:text=Welfare%20for%20the%20Well,Business%20Subsidies%20Fleece%20Taxpayers)). And that’s just federal; states also give out billions in corporate tax incentives to lure businesses (often prompting a “race to the bottom” where companies pit states against each other for bigger handouts). Compare that ~$100 billion to, say, the SNAP program (~$113 billion in 2023) or TANF (~$16 billion). We are effectively giving as much to corporations (many of them extremely profitable) as we spend on helping low-income families buy food. Yet, **“welfare” in political discourse rarely includes these corporate benefits**.

- **Bailouts and Taxpayer Risk:** The 2008 financial crisis saw an unprecedented bailout of banks and financial institutions (the $700 billion TARP program, plus trillions in Fed backstops). While much of TARP was repaid, the fact remains that **Wall Street’s recklessness was rescued by taxpayer funds** – a classic case of privatized profits and socialized losses. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress authorized over $500 billion in loans and grants to corporations (airlines, large employers) plus a $4+ *trillion* Federal Reserve credit facility to keep capital markets afloat. Corporations didn’t hesitate to take this government lifeline – even as some of their CEOs and lobbyists argue against government spending on individuals. Notably, companies like airlines spent years on stock buybacks (enriching shareholders) then received generous bailouts when the pandemic hit. **No moral hazard talk there** – it was deemed necessary to save the economy. Similarly, auto companies got bailouts in 2009. The pattern: when corporations are in trouble, massive public resources are marshaled to help them (often justified, to prevent collapse and job loss, but nonetheless a subsidy). However, when poor families need help, suddenly we hear about “dependency” and needing harsh conditions. This double standard is stark.

- **Tax Loopholes and Subsidies:** The tax code is full of provisions that effectively act as “corporate welfare.” For example, some highly profitable companies end up paying *zero federal income tax* in a given year due to loopholes. A recent report found dozens of Fortune 500 firms (like Amazon, Netflix) paid $0 in federal taxes in certain years, exploiting deductions and credits. Those foregone taxes are like a subsidy – the government could have collected tens of billions more if not for special breaks. One could argue that **closing those loopholes** would raise far more than any savings from trimming food stamps. There are also industry-specific subsidies: **fossil fuel companies** receive an estimated $4–6 billion annually in direct subsidies (and much more if you count externalities not priced). **Big Pharma** benefits from government-funded research (NIH) that it can then patent and profit from. **Defense contractors** thrive on huge government contracts (the Pentagon budget feeds companies like Lockheed Martin, effectively a form of guaranteed business). Even **tech companies** got started with government-funded innovations (the internet, GPS, etc.). In sum, the government is deeply involved in supporting business – which is not inherently bad, but it belies the notion that we have a pure free market. The question is why helping a poor person pay rent is demonized while helping a rich corporation is accepted or even praised as “economic development.”

- **“Corporate Welfare vs Social Welfare” – by the numbers:** To put things in perspective, consider the **2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act**, which primarily benefited corporations and the wealthy: it cost an estimated $1.5 trillion over 10 years – essentially an outflow of that much from public coffers to private hands. Meanwhile, proposals to increase spending on, say, childcare or food assistance are often in the mere tens of billions and are attacked as too costly. Another example: Each year, the U.S. spends about $70 billion on SNAP (in a normal pre-pandemic year) and around $80 billion on all housing assistance. By contrast, **tax breaks for homeownership (mortgage interest deduction)** – which skew to higher-income homeowners – cost around $60+ billion annually. So a middle-class homeowner writing off interest (a benefit not available to renters) is a larger budget line than rental aid for the poor. This is seldom framed as “welfare,” but it is a subsidy through the tax code. Likewise, **capital gains are taxed at a lower rate** than wages, effectively a subsidy to investors that costs the Treasury an estimated $125 billion a year (2019). We can see that **“welfare for the wealthy”** is real – but it’s baked into policy subtly.

- **CEO and Political Hypocrisy:** Many corporate executives and politicians decry government “handouts” while taking plenty themselves. For instance, several large companies that lobbied against expanded unemployment benefits during COVID had themselves taken *Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans* that were later forgiven. Some millionaire members of Congress who oppose student loan forgiveness quietly benefited from PPP loan forgiveness – an irony not lost on critics. We also have cases like rich farmers in Congress who receive farm subsidies yet vote to cut food stamps. The **CEO of a major bank** might warn against the dangers of big government spending even as his industry exists under the umbrella of federal deposit insurance and Fed support (which are essentially government guarantees). This hypocrisy often extends to *calling workers “lazy” for needing benefits while the company actively keeps wages low*. Walmart was a prime example: the Walton family (among the richest in the world) long resisted wage hikes for their workers, even as studies showed Walmart workers rely on $6 billion in public aid ([
	
	  Consumer Action - Walmart workers cost taxpayers $6.2 billion In public assistance
  
](https://www.consumer-action.org/news/articles/walmart_workers_cost_taxpayers_6.2_billion_in_public_assistance#:~:text=Walmart%E2%80%99s%20low,with%20Tax%20Day%2C%20April%2015)). Essentially, taxpayers subsidize Walmart’s low pay. The Walton heirs, however, benefit from tax breaks on dividends and estates. When one hears rhetoric about “makers and takers,” it’s worth asking: who are the real takers? Many would point to those who take multi-million-dollar bonuses funded by bailout money or those who exploit public infrastructure and bailouts to build private wealth, then lobby to slash programs for the poor.

- **Corporate Lobbying and Policy Capture:** One reason corporate welfare persists is lobbying. Big companies spend lavishly on lobbyists and campaign donations to secure tax breaks and favorable regulations. For example, the private equity industry lobbies hard to keep the “carried interest” loophole (letting billionaire financiers pay low taxes), and they’ve succeeded for years. Oil companies lobby to preserve subsidies and favorable drilling rights. This influence often far outweighs any advocacy poor people can muster. So policy can end up generous to the well-off and stingy to the neediest, not by accident but by design of those with power and money. This is important to realize when we talk about “why doesn’t government just cut wasteful corporate subsidies” – those subsidies have powerful protectors. It also contextualizes debates on deficits: The same lawmakers who say “we can’t afford more food aid” often voted for large tax cuts or spending that benefited special interests.

In sum, **“corporate welfare” is the elephant in the room**. Critics who focus only on welfare for individuals are missing where a lot of your tax dollars actually go. The political right often uses anti-welfare rhetoric to suggest fiscal discipline, but when it comes to corporate benefits, that discipline vanishes. As one scholar quipped, in America we have “**socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor**” – meaning the wealthy get safety nets and support, while the poor are told to fend for themselves in the market. Recognizing this double standard is key to having an honest conversation about government spending and “handouts.” Any serious attempt to reduce government waste or dependency should logically scrutinize corporate subsidies with at least as much zeal as social programs.

## 5. Broader Political and Economic Implications

Finally, let’s zoom out to the bigger picture: how are these narratives – about immigrants, welfare, “us vs. them” – used in politics, and what are the real forces at play?

**Fear-Based Politics and the “Othering” of Immigrants:**  
It’s clear that **exploiting fear** is an effective political strategy. Right-wing narratives often paint immigrants as a threatening “other” – invaders at the border, criminals in our neighborhoods, people who don’t share “our” values. This fear-based framing taps into primal concerns about safety and identity. Politicians amplify isolated incidents (like a terrible crime by an undocumented person) to generalize about millions of peaceful immigrants. They use charged language like “**invasion**” and “cartel armies” to make the border seem out of control. This is *demonstrably manipulative*: as we saw, immigrant crime rates are lower than native crime rates ([New Cato Research Shows That Illegal Immigrants Are Less Likely to Be Convicted of Murder in Texas | Cato at Liberty Blog](https://www.cato.org/blog/new-cato-research-shows-illegal-immigrants-are-less-likely-be-convicted-murder-texas#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20Cato%20Institute,2%20per%20100%2C000%20legal%20immigrants)), and undocumented population numbers had been stable or declining for much of the past decade ([PolitiFact | MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally ](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/#:~:text=Brown%E2%80%99s%20office%20cited%20U,just%20under%20264%2C000%20in%201971)). Yet by hammering on fear, they create a sense of crisis. Why? Fear is a proven motivator for voter turnout and support. If voters are led to believe that their way of life is under siege by hordes of illegals or that their tax dollars are being stolen by freeloaders, they may rally behind hardline candidates. It’s a cynical but often successful approach. Historically, this tactic isn’t limited to any one group – it’s been used against African Americans (the “Southern Strategy” during the Civil Rights era stoked white fears), against Muslims post-9/11 (fear of terrorism used to justify broad-brush policies), and certainly against immigrants in many periods. The **“Great Replacement” theory** – a conspiratorial idea that elites are replacing native-born Americans with immigrants – has moved from the fringe to some segments of right-wing discourse, directly playing on racial fears. Social science research shows that when people feel threatened, they gravitate to authoritarian and exclusionary attitudes ([Private prison industry shifts focus to immigrant detention centers, funding immigration hawks • OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/#:~:text=Private%20prison%20interests%20boost%20pro,security%20politicians)). Politicians exploiting this know exactly what they’re doing. It allows them to **distract from other issues** too: it’s easier to blame immigrants for crime or low wages than to tackle complicated root causes like gun policy or corporate monopoly power suppressing wages. Fear-based manipulation is essentially a divide-and-conquer strategy – get working and middle-class citizens to blame immigrants (or the poor, or minorities) for their problems, instead of looking upward at how wealth and power are structured.

**The Role of Corporate Lobbying and Interests in the Immigration “Crisis” Narrative:**  
It might seem counterintuitive, but certain corporate interests actually benefit from the **perpetuation of an immigration crisis narrative**. Private prison and detention companies are a prime example. Companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic run immigrant detention centers under government contract – the more people detained (and the longer they’re held), the more profit for them. These companies have **poured money into lobbying and donations** to politicians who push strict immigration enforcement and expanded detention ([Private prison industry shifts focus to immigrant detention centers, funding immigration hawks • OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/#:~:text=Private%20prison%20interests%20boost%20pro,security%20politicians)) ([Private prison industry shifts focus to immigrant detention centers, funding immigration hawks • OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/#:~:text=The%20private%20prison%20industry%20directly,these%20zero%20tolerance%20immigration%20policies)). OpenSecrets research showed private prison industry donations heavily favor immigration hawks in Congress ([Private prison industry shifts focus to immigrant detention centers, funding immigration hawks • OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/#:~:text=Private%20prison%20interests%20boost%20pro,security%20politicians)). They backed policies like mandatory detention, family separation (which increased detention of parents and kids), and opposition to alternatives to detention. Similarly, the security industry (those who make surveillance tech, border wall materials, etc.) have an interest in a “secure the border” spending surge. Billions were allocated for border barriers and high-tech surveillance contracts; companies in those sectors benefited and often lobbied for continued funding. Even the media companies benefit – outrage and fear boosts TV ratings and online clicks, making the “border crisis” a lucrative news cycle to keep running. On the other hand, some industries rely on immigrant labor (agriculture, hospitality, construction), which historically lobbied for more lenient policies or guest worker programs. This creates a contradiction: big agriculture might tacitly want a steady flow of undocumented workers to keep labor costs down, even as politicians allied with them rail against illegal immigration. One might recall how during the Trump administration, despite harsh rhetoric, there was not a significant reduction in visa programs for seasonal workers that businesses needed. **Corporate lobbying thus sometimes pushes both ways** – but crucially, those who profit from enforcement (prisons, contractors) have successfully gained influence. The result is that the immigration “crisis” is often sustained because it is profitable or politically useful to various actors, even if comprehensive reform (which could resolve the status of undocumented workers and create a better system) would benefit the economy and society overall. 

**Climate Change and U.S. Foreign Policy as Overlooked Drivers of Migration:**  
Many of the people arriving at the U.S. border, especially from Central America, are responding to factors that **the U.S. helped create** – whether indirectly through climate change or directly through foreign policy. **Climate change** is now a significant push factor: severe droughts, hurricanes, and crop failures in Central America’s “Dry Corridor” have devastated subsistence farmers, compelling them to migrate for survival ([In Central America, disasters and climate change are defining](https://environmentalmigration.iom.int/blogs/central-america-disasters-and-climate-change-are-defining-migration-trends#:~:text=defining%20environmentalmigration,of%20environmental%20and%20climate%20change)) ([Elevated risks and forced migration: The impacts of climate change ...](https://lwr.org/blog/2022/elevated-risks-and-forced-migration-impacts-climate-change-coffee-farmers#:~:text=Elevated%20risks%20and%20forced%20migration%3A,The%20Future%20of%20Coffee)). For example, prolonged drought linked to climate change has repeatedly wiped out harvests in Guatemala and Honduras, leaving families hungry. When we see more families from those countries at our border, one cause is literally the weather – extreme events intensified by global warming (to which the U.S. has historically been the largest contributor in emissions). The World Bank projects that **climate change could displace over 140 million people by 2050 within their countries** (and many will then cross borders) if global action is insufficient ([Climate Change Could Force Over 140 Million to Migrate Within ...](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/03/19/climate-change-could-force-over-140-million-to-migrate-within-countries-by-2050-world-bank-report#:~:text=Climate%20Change%20Could%20Force%20Over,within%20their%20countries%27%20borders)) ([Environmental Migration](https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/environmental-migration#:~:text=Environmental%20Migration%20It%20is%20expected,to%20reduce%20global%20greenhouse)). So any serious discussion of migration “crises” needs to include climate mitigation and aid to help regions adapt, or else we’re just treating symptoms, not causes. 

U.S. **foreign policy** and actions have also shaped migration patterns. In Central America, the U.S. has a long history of intervention: from backing coups (e.g. Guatemala 1954) to supporting military regimes in the 1980s in El Salvador and Honduras. These actions often exacerbated violence and instability. The **Guardian** summarized it pointedly: families fleeing from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras are in part escaping “a hell the U.S. helped create” ([Fleeing a hell the US helped create: why Central Americans journey north](https://ibw21.org/commentary/fleeing-a-hell-the-us-helped-create-why-central-americans-journey-north/#:~:text=The%20region%E2%80%99s%20inequality%20and%20violence%2C,people%20to%20leave%20their%20homes)) ([Fleeing a hell the US helped create: why Central Americans journey north](https://ibw21.org/commentary/fleeing-a-hell-the-us-helped-create-why-central-americans-journey-north/#:~:text=The%20forces%20driving%20ordinary%20people,long%20played%20a%20defining%20role)). For instance, during the Salvadoran civil war, the U.S. funded the government despite atrocities, contributing to refugee outflows. In Honduras, the U.S.-supported 2009 coup led to a cascade of instability, corruption, and crime, fueling more emigration. The U.S. “War on Drugs” pressured Latin American governments into militarized campaigns that sometimes worsened violence and drove people north. Even economically, trade policies like **NAFTA** had complex effects: while beneficial overall, NAFTA led to cheap U.S. corn flooding Mexican markets, putting many small Mexican farmers out of business – some of whom then migrated. The key point: **many migrants don’t *want* to leave their homes**; they are driven by desperation stemming from violence, political upheaval, or economic ruin, conditions to which U.S. policies have sometimes contributed ([Fleeing a hell the US helped create: why Central Americans journey north](https://ibw21.org/commentary/fleeing-a-hell-the-us-helped-create-why-central-americans-journey-north/#:~:text=The%20forces%20driving%20ordinary%20people,long%20played%20a%20defining%20role)) ([Fleeing a hell the US helped create: why Central Americans journey north](https://ibw21.org/commentary/fleeing-a-hell-the-us-helped-create-why-central-americans-journey-north/#:~:text=Experts%20on%20the%20region%20argue%2C,when%20they%20have%20been%20slaughtered)). This doesn’t mean the U.S. alone is to blame, but it means a truly effective approach to migration would involve investing in stabilizing and developing those source countries (as the Biden Administration’s proposed “Root Causes” strategy aims to do) rather than only fortifying the border. It also means acknowledging our moral responsibility: turning away people whose lives were upended partly by our actions (or inactions on climate) is ethically fraught.

**"America First" Populism and Its Hidden Costs to American Workers:**  
Right-wing populism often brands itself as championing the “American worker” through slogans like “America First.” In practice, how have such policies affected workers? The results are mixed and often counterproductive. Take the **trade war and tariffs** of 2018-2019: Tariffs were imposed on Chinese goods, steel, etc., intended to protect U.S. industries. What happened? Some U.S. steel mills did see a temporary boost, but industries that *use* steel (auto manufacturing, machinery) faced higher input costs and shed jobs. One study concluded that the trade war *cost around 245,000 American jobs* overall ([How Trump's Tariffs Really Affected the U.S. Job Market](https://carnegieendowment.org/china-financial-markets/2021/01/how-trumps-tariffs-really-affected-the-us-job-market?lang=en#:~:text=How%20Trump%27s%20Tariffs%20Really%20Affected,nearly%20a%20quarter%20million%20jobs)). Farmers were hit hard by retaliatory tariffs from China (e.g. on soybeans), requiring the government to spend ~$28 billion in bailout payments to farmers – which interestingly was the **largest agricultural subsidy program in decades**, effectively **corporate welfare to fix a self-inflicted wound**. “America First” in trade ended up meaning **higher prices for consumers** (tariffs are taxes) and chaotic supply chains, without a clear revival of manufacturing. Similarly, on immigration, crackdowns aimed at “protecting American workers” have often hurt industries like agriculture and construction by depriving them of needed labor, leading to labor shortages and lost economic output ([Trump immigration crackdown raises concerns for agriculture](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2025/01/30/mass-deportations-agriculture-migrant-labor#:~:text=agriculture%20spectrumlocalnews,shortage%20in%20the%20agriculture)) ([The Hidden Cost of Immigration Crackdowns on U.S. Agriculture](https://www.foodlogistics.com/sustainability/agriculture/article/22928435/efficio-the-hidden-cost-of-immigration-crackdowns-on-us-agriculture#:~:text=The%20Hidden%20Cost%20of%20Immigration,heightened%20food%20waste%2C%20and)). For example, the dairy industry (which relies heavily on immigrant labor) struggled to find American-born workers willing to take those jobs when immigration enforcement tightened – threatening farm closures. So the simplistic notion that deporting immigrants = more jobs for natives doesn’t hold; the jobs often either remain unfilled or get outsourced/automated. Another aspect is that by focusing anger on immigrants, “America First” leaders distract from policies that **really could help workers**, like raising the minimum wage, expanding healthcare, or strengthening unions – measures generally opposed by the same politicians. Instead, they offer protectionism and nativism as solutions. But while blaming immigrants or foreign nations may win votes, it doesn’t address long-term issues like technological change, monopolistic corporate practices, or inadequate social safety nets that *truly* impact workers. In fact, anti-immigrant and anti-regulation fervor can harm workers: for instance, reduced immigration in tech and medicine can stifle innovation and growth (fewer startups, fewer doctors in rural areas, etc.), ultimately limiting job creation and services for Americans. “America First” can also sour international relations, which in turn can hurt export industries and thus jobs (e.g. U.S. farmers losing markets abroad). 

In short, many “America First” policies have been **self-defeating for the very workers they purport to help**. They serve a narrative of standing up for the little guy, but often deliver little. Meanwhile, policies that *would* significantly help working Americans – like investing in education, infrastructure, or negotiating cheaper healthcare – are neglected or undermined by the same politicians if it doesn’t fit their ideological agenda. It’s telling that as the government enacted tax cuts for corporations in 2017, the minimum wage at the federal level remained stuck at $7.25 (where it’s been since 2009). The populist rhetoric didn’t translate into economic populism in policy; it largely became cultural populism (us vs. them) without economic justice. 

**Who Benefits from Division?**  
Ultimately, one must ask: who benefits when the public is divided over immigration and welfare? Often, it’s the powerful who benefit. As long as **working-class conservatives blame immigrants for low wages, and working-class liberals blame “deplorable” racists for blocking progress, we aren’t uniting to demand accountability from the real power brokers** – corporations and politicians who rig policies in favor of the very rich. It’s a classic divide-and-conquer: racial and ethnic division has historically been used in the U.S. to prevent multiracial worker coalitions. For example, in the late 1800s, rail barons encouraged white workers to resent Chinese workers instead of unionizing together. Today, if public attention is on a migrant caravan as the source of trouble, there’s less attention on, say, how the top 0.1% has captured most income gains. Misinformation and fear weaken the solidarity needed to push for policies that help *all* working people (native or immigrant). 

**The Path Forward – Solutions and Rebuttals:**  
So, given these facts, how can we move toward solutions? Firstly, **fact-checking and education** are vital – hence this report. By debunking myths, we hope more citizens will question scapegoating and demand rational policy. 

- **Immigration Policy Solutions:** A pragmatic approach would include comprehensive immigration reform – something that has been stalled for decades. This means creating a legal path for the ~11 million undocumented (most of whom are long-time, peaceful residents) to earn legal status and citizenship, rather than keeping them as an exploitable underclass. It means **modernizing the legal immigration system**: increasing visa numbers to meet labor demand (especially for both high-skilled and agricultural workers), reducing backlogs, and implementing smarter security (invest in ports of entry scanning, track visa overstays with better tech). Lessons from Canada/Australia could be applied – e.g., a points-based system for some immigrants, but without discarding family reunification which has been a bedrock of American immigration. Enforcement should focus on real threats (criminal gangs, trafficking) and use humane, efficient processes for others (like asylum seekers should get prompt hearings and fair treatment, not indefinite detention). The border situation would also improve with more **processing centers and legal channels** for asylum/refugees, so fewer people feel compelled to cross illegally. Internationally, the U.S. should invest in **addressing root causes**: support development, anti-corruption, and violence prevention in countries sending many migrants (there’s evidence that aid targeted properly can reduce emigration over time). And very importantly, **climate action** – leading global efforts to mitigate climate change – is part of immigration policy, because it will reduce future displacement.

- **Welfare and Economic Policy Solutions:** To truly help American workers and reduce resentment, we should aim for an economy where fewer people *need* welfare because jobs pay a living wage. That means policies like raising the federal minimum wage, strengthening labor rights to bargain for better pay, and maybe expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit further. At the same time, we shouldn’t gut the safety net; we should *strengthen* certain parts of it – for instance, housing assistance and healthcare, which are critical for stability. When people aren’t crushed by medical bills or rent, they have a better chance to train, work, and move up. Also, making some benefits more universal (as many European countries do) can reduce the stigma and political targeting. For example, if childcare assistance or college aid is available to the middle class too, it becomes an accepted norm rather than a resented “welfare.” It’s also past time to rethink punitive policies from the 1990s; evidence shows some (like harsh time limits on TANF) increased deep poverty without clear benefits. **Addressing fraud** is always a consideration, but as we saw, current fraud levels are low – still, improving technology for verification can catch fraudsters while making it easier for eligible folks to get help (for instance, using data matching to auto-enroll those who qualify). 

- **Corporate Responsibility:** It’s reasonable to demand that corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share. Closing corporate tax loopholes, implementing a minimum corporate tax (as was recently legislated at 15% for large firms), and enforcing tax laws on high earners can fund social programs without increasing deficit. We should scrutinize subsidies: some, like those for clean energy, may be good policy to promote public goods – but many others (like oil subsidies or stadium deals for sports teams) might be eliminated or redirected to more productive uses. If a company like Walmart has a workforce largely on Medicaid and SNAP, perhaps we implement policies (or moral pressure) to raise their wage floor or require them to contribute to a fund that offsets those public costs. **Aligning corporate incentives with public good** is tricky but vital; for instance, maybe condition certain bailouts or subsidies on companies improving worker pay or domestic investment. 

- **Political Reform:** Lastly, addressing the root of manipulation requires some political reform. Campaign finance reform could reduce the outsized influence of corporate money, making lawmakers more accountable to voters than donors. Stronger media accountability or support for quality journalism can help counter the flood of misinformation. Investing in civic education would help future voters spot logical fallacies and scare tactics. Some have also suggested that a more proportional or multi-party electoral system could reduce the zero-sum polarization that encourages extreme rhetoric (this is a longer-term structural change). In the near term, it’s about building coalitions across traditional divides: for instance, uniting labor unions, immigrant rights groups, and others around the idea that **the enemy is not our fellow working person (of any origin), but policies that favor the elite few at the expense of the many**.

**Conclusion:**  
Immigration and welfare are complex issues, but the evidence is clear: immigrants overall contribute positively to the economy and society, and our welfare programs, while not perfect, alleviate hardship and invest in human potential. The common arguments vilifying immigrants or the poor are built on misrepresentation and sometimes outright falsehoods. They serve political ends – to gin up fear or anger – but do not serve the public interest. By confronting these myths with facts, we can have more productive discussions. Instead of “immigrants vs natives” or “moochers vs taxpayers,” the real frame should be **common people vs common problems**: how do we grow the economy, adapt to globalization and climate change, reduce inequality, and ensure opportunity for all? Scapegoating immigrants or gutting the safety net won’t solve these challenges – it will only divide and weaken us. 

Armed with the facts presented – from crime stats and tax contributions to historical lessons and spending data – readers can push back when they hear false claims. When someone says “illegals are pouring in and living off welfare,” you now know how to respond: *Actually, no – unauthorized crossings are not unprecedented and nearly half of “illegals” came legally but overstayed; they can’t get welfare and in fact contribute billions in taxes ([The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/#:~:text=estimates%20that%20about%201,undocumented%20immigrants%20on%20Social%20Security)) ([Do Undocumented Immigrants Overuse Government Benefits? | Econofact](https://econofact.org/do-undocumented-immigrants-overuse-government-benefits#:~:text=,emergency%20Medicaid%2C%20the)). Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans ([New Cato Research Shows That Illegal Immigrants Are Less Likely to Be Convicted of Murder in Texas | Cato at Liberty Blog](https://www.cato.org/blog/new-cato-research-shows-illegal-immigrants-are-less-likely-be-convicted-murder-texas#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20Cato%20Institute,2%20per%20100%2C000%20legal%20immigrants)). And by the way, why aren’t we talking about the billions in subsidies and tax breaks going to corporations?* By reframing and presenting solid evidence, we can challenge the manipulation. 

The hope is that with better public understanding, we can shift the political landscape away from fear-mongering and toward **solutions that truly make America stronger and fairer** – an immigration system that is humane and efficient, an economy that rewards work and provides dignity, and a government that invests in its people rather than in boondoggles or divisive walls. Achieving this requires recognizing the misinformation for what it is and refusing to be ruled by it. Facts and empathy must counter fear. Only then can we break the cycle of scapegoating and work together on the real issues that matter.
