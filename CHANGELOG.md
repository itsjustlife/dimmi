# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Normalize WHERE taxonomy; rename folders; add Maps & Wayfinding service; update links; export OPML/JSON.
- Document the Door content drawer, search tile, attach flow, and classic deep link behavior.
- Ship the Door Builder workflow and attach wizard, documenting how to edit rooms and teleports in Door mode.
- Add `scripts/normalize_links.php` to normalize ARKHIVE Markdown links (with a `--check` dry run) so Door teleports stay consistent.
