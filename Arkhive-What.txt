========================================
WHAT – Domains, Concepts, and Things
========================================
The WHAT branch houses all the topics, subjects, objects, and abstract concepts in the Arkhive knowledge base. If something is primarily defined by its nature, properties, or field rather than who made it, where it is, when it occurred, or why it matters, it likely belongs here. This file explains how the WHAT hierarchy is organized and best practices for populating it.

========================================
SECTION 1: SCOPE OF WHAT
========================================
WHAT includes:
- Knowledge Domains: Broad fields of study (Mathematics, History, Biology, Philosophy, Technology, Arts). Serve as high-level organizational nodes.
- Concepts and Theories: Specific ideas (Quantum Entanglement, Democracy, Impressionism, Natural Selection). Core definitions and explanations reside here.
- Objects and Entities (Non-persons): Tangible items (Steam Engine, Volcano, Smartphone) or specific unique artifacts (Statue of Liberty, Hubble Telescope). Distinguishes between general concepts (Volcano) and specific instances (WHERE:Mount Vesuvius).
- Subjects of Inquiry: Defined problems or questions (P vs NP problem in Computer Science).
- Categories and Classifications: Taxonomical groups (Mammals, Genres of Music, Types of Fallacies - though fallacies might also fit MIND).
- Events (Conceptual Aspect): While primarily in WHEN, the *concept* of an event type (e.g., "Revolution" as a concept) or a specific named event considered as a topic ("The French Revolution" - what it entailed) might have a descriptive entry here, cross-linked with WHEN.
- Processes/Methods (Conceptual Aspect): Since HOW may be integrated, descriptions of processes (Photosynthesis, Scientific Method, PCR) often reside here under their relevant domain (Biology, Science, etc.).

========================================
SECTION 2: STRUCTURE AND SUBCATEGORIES
========================================

2.1. Primary Structure: Often mirrors academic/library classifications.
    - Top Level: Broad fields (Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Arts & Culture, Technology, Humanities, Mathematics).
    - Second Level: Specific domains within fields (Physics, Chemistry, Biology under Natural Sciences).
    - Lower Levels: Subtopics, theories, concepts, notable examples within domains (Physics -> Quantum Mechanics -> Quantum Entanglement).

2.2. Handling General vs. Domain Concepts:
    - Integrate concepts within relevant domains where possible (e.g., Utilitarianism under Philosophy > Ethics).
    - Cross-disciplinary concepts (e.g., "Chaos Theory") might appear under a primary domain (Mathematics) with cross-links from others (Physics, Philosophy) or reside in a high-level "Interdisciplinary Concepts" node if necessary.
    - Avoid overly generic "Concepts" buckets; aim for meaningful placement.

2.3. Objects and Things:
    - Integrate within domains (Steam Engine under Technology > Industrial Revolution) or group by type (Tools, Devices, Natural Features - ensuring distinction from specific instances in WHERE).

2.4. Alternative Structures (Supplemental):
    - An A-Z index of all concepts could be generated but is not the primary navigation method.

========================================
SECTION 3: ENTRY CONVENTIONS
========================================
- Definitions: Provide concise, clear, neutral definitions (1-3 sentences) capturing the essence of the concept/object.
- Subtopics: Structure broader topics logically using nested lists or sub-nodes (e.g., Quantum Mechanics node contains sub-nodes for key principles/experiments).
- Examples: Include illustrative examples where helpful (e.g., Metaphor entry gives "time is a thief").
- Succinctness: Keep entries focused on core ideas and links. Avoid full textbook chapters; aim for encyclopedia-entry length. The Arkhive provides structure and core knowledge; Dimmi generates depth.
- Categorization Notes: If a concept spans multiple domains or could fit elsewhere, add a note explicitly stating this and providing cross-links (e.g., "Evolution (Biology concept) – (Concept also influences Philosophy – see WHY...)").

========================================
SECTION 4: CROSS-LINKS AND RELATIONS
========================================
WHAT nodes are highly interconnected:
- WHO links: Link concepts/theories/inventions to key people associated (General Relativity -> WHO:Einstein; Photography -> WHO:Daguerre). Link domains to pioneers (Computing -> WHO:Turing).
- WHERE links: Link concepts tied to specific places (Silk Road concept -> WHERE:Asia/Europe route; Chernobyl Disaster concept -> WHERE:Chernobyl). Link natural objects to general locations (Volcano concept -> WHERE: various volcanic regions).
- WHEN links: Link concepts to their historical context (Renaissance Art -> WHEN:Renaissance period; Internet -> WHEN:1969/ARPANET, 1990s/WWW). Link scientific discoveries/theories to their dates. Event concepts link strongly to event timelines.
- WHY links: Link concepts to related ideologies, motivations, or causes (Communism concept -> WHY:Political Ideologies; AI Bias concept -> WHY:Social Impact/Ethics). Cross-link extensively between WHAT definitions and WHY explanations/motivations.
- HOW links: Link concepts describing methods/processes (Scientific Method, PCR) to potential HOW applications or detailed steps (conceptually, if HOW integrated here).
- MIND links: Link concepts related to cognition/logic (Game Theory, Cognitive Dissonance) to corresponding entries in `arkhive-mind.txt`.
- Within WHAT links ("See Also"): Link related concepts (Electricity -> see also: Magnetism). Use parenthetical notes or dedicated "Related Concepts" lists.

========================================
SECTION 5: MANAGING DOMAIN OVERLAP
========================================
- Primary Home: For concepts spanning domains (Bioethics), choose a primary location (e.g., under Biology if focus is application) and use cross-links or stub entries in secondary locations (e.g., reference from Philosophy > Ethics).
- Consistency: Ensure duplicate entries (if used for multi-placement) point to a single primary definition to avoid divergence. Use clear cross-referencing.

========================================
SECTION 6: EXAMPLE STRUCTURE EXCERPT (Illustrative)
========================================
(Using indented list format)

- Science
    - Physics
        - Quantum Mechanics
            - *Quantum Entanglement* – Phenomenon where particles share states...
            - *Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle* – Principle stating limits on measuring paired properties...
            - *Double-slit Experiment* – Demo of wave-particle duality (see WHEN:1801)...
        - Relativity
            - *General Relativity* – Einstein’s gravity theory (1915)... (see WHO:Einstein)
            - *Special Relativity* – Einstein’s 1905 theory (speed of light constant...).
    - Biology
        - Evolution
            - *Natural Selection* – Mechanism... (Darwinian concept - see WHO:Darwin).
            - *DNA* – Molecule carrying genetic instructions (Discovered 1953; see WHO:Watson, Crick).
- Technology
    - Computing
        - *Internet* – Global network... (Est. late 20th c.; see WHEN:1983/ARPANET).
        - *Artificial Intelligence (AI)*
            - *Machine Learning* – Algorithms improving via data... (see MIND:Neural Networks).
            - *GPT Models* – AI language models... (see WHO:OpenAI).
- Arts & Culture
    - Literature
        - *Magic Realism* – Genre blending realistic narrative/surreal elements... (see WHO:García Márquez).

========================================
SECTION 7: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
========================================
- Concept vs. Instance: Distinguish class (Smartphone - WHAT) from specific instance (iPhone - maybe WHAT sub-node or example). Notable unique instances (Hubble Telescope) get own WHAT entry.
- Avoid Trivia: Focus on concepts relevant to core knowledge or user context, not exhaustive lists of minor items (unless required).
- Updating Concepts: Add new terms/concepts as they emerge (Quantum Computing, new AI models) under appropriate domains. Use EXPAND command suggestions when adding new areas. Keep tech/culture examples current. Mark time-sensitive info ("(as of 2025)").

========================================
SECTION 8: SUPPLEMENTAL REFINEMENT PROMPTS (For Future Iteration)
========================================
- Consolidate Overlapping Nodes: Periodically audit for synonyms or concepts entered separately; merge/redirect for clarity (VR vs. Virtual Reality).
- Tag Concepts with Domains: Implement inline or metadata tags for domains `[Biology]`, `[Physics]` to aid disambiguation and cross-disciplinary search.
- Abstract "Theory Stack": Consider a top-level node for highly abstract/universal concepts (Time, Truth, Causality) if they become scattered.
- Leverage External Ontologies: Use external sources (Wikipedia categories, WordNet) as reference for classifying ambiguous new concepts.
- Keep Examples Current: Schedule review/updates for examples in rapidly evolving fields like technology or pop culture.

The WHAT Branch: Exploring Objects and Ideas

The WHAT category of the Arkhive is a vast conceptual territory encompassing everything that can be a thing – from physical artifacts and tools to abstract theories and domains of knowledge. It spans both the concrete (entities we can touch, see, or measure) and the abstract (entities we can only conceptualize or imagine)​

 In this branch, a telescope or a microchip finds a place alongside ideas like gravity or virtue ethics. The WHAT branch includes physical matter, technologies, software, philosophical constructs, scientific principles, artistic works, and entire fields of knowledge. It is essentially the ontology of “things” — both tangible and intangible — that humans study, create, use, or contemplate.
Scope of WHAT: From the Concrete to the Conceptual
To clarify the scope, here are illustrative subdomains of the WHAT branch and a few examples of each:

Natural World (Physical Entities): The realm of naturally occurring objects and phenomena. This ranges from concrete objects like minerals and plants to grandiose systems like planets and galaxies. For example: a mountain, a DNA molecule, or the planet Jupiter. Natural forces and phenomena (like gravity or a hurricane) also live here as “things” we identify in nature.

Human-Made Artifacts & Technologies: All tools, machines, infrastructure, and digital artifacts engineered or crafted by people. This includes everything from a hammer or a smartphone to large-scale systems like airplanes or the Internet. Software and virtual objects are included too – a programming language or an algorithm is treated as a “what” (an entity in itself). For example: the telescope (a scientific instrument), the Python programming language, or the concept of blockchain technology.

Concepts & Ideas: Intangible ideas, theories, and constructs that exist in thought. These range from scientific theories (like relativity) and mathematical abstractions to philosophical and aesthetic concepts (like the sublime in art). For example: virtue ethics (a framework in philosophy), the principle of supply and demand (an economic concept), or the notion of justice. Even mythic or speculative constructs find a place here, clearly marked as such – e.g. chakras in esoteric traditions or Plato’s ideal forms.

Knowledge Domains & Disciplines: Recognizable fields of knowledge or study, each of which contains its own network of sub-topics and concepts. This includes academic disciplines and sciences – everything from physics to literature. Each domain is a “what” in the sense of being a defined area of knowledge. For example: biology (a natural science), computer science (a formal science), history (a humanity), or medicine (an applied science). These domains often encompass many smaller “what” entries (e.g. within biology: genetics, cell theory, evolution, etc.).

Creative Works & Cultural Artifacts: The products of human creativity and culture are also part of WHAT. This covers arts, media, and entertainment. Individual works like a novel, a painting, a symphony, or a film, as well as categories like musical genres and art movements, fall under this subdomain. For example: Shakespeare’s Hamlet (a literary work), Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony (a musical composition), the film Star Wars, or the video game Minecraft – all of these are “what” items (creative objects or artifacts of culture).

These examples illustrate how WHAT can refer to a concrete item (a telescope), a system or technology (a programming language), a natural phenomenon (gravity), a philosophy (virtue ethics), an aesthetic category (the sublime), or a knowledge field (physics). The branch is structured to handle this diversity, organizing entries into intuitive clusters so that users can navigate from the very concrete to the very abstract with ease. It is not uncommon for something in the WHAT branch to straddle categories – for instance, “the Internet” is a technology, but also a sprawling system with social implications. The hierarchy is designed to be flexible and richly cross-referenced, so such items can be contextualized appropriately.
Interplay with WHO, WHERE, HOW, WHY, and MIND/SYNTAX

Every what is connected to other dimensions of understanding. The Arkhive’s branches are interlinked, and the WHAT branch is enriched by its interactions with the other categories:

WHO (Agents & People): Many “what” items are created, used, or studied by who entries. For example, the concept of algorithms (WHAT) is advanced by Alan Turing (WHO), and the theory of relativity (WHAT) is tied to Albert Einstein (WHO). In the hierarchy, cross-notes link inventions and ideas to their inventors, discoverers, or notable practitioners. (e.g., see WHO: Alan Turing on a node about early computers).
WHERE (Contexts & Origins): The where branch gives geographical or spatial context to “what” items. Physical objects have places of origin or use – e.g. coffee as a product (WHAT) and its origins in Ethiopia (WHERE). Knowledge domains and technologies also have cultural or historical epicenters – the field of astronomy (WHAT) might be linked to Ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy (WHERE) in context.
HOW (Methods & Processes): The how branch captures processes, techniques, and mechanisms. Often, to understand what something is, we also want to know how it works. For instance, the WHAT entry “printing press” would naturally connect to how printing processes operate. Similarly, scientific concepts in WHAT (like photosynthesis) link to the explanatory process in HOW (the step-by-step mechanism of photosynthesis).

WHY (Purpose & Motivation):

 The why branch illuminates reasons, purposes, or motivations behind things. Every technology or concept in WHAT has underlying “why” questions: Why was this created? Why is it important? For example, a medical vaccine (WHAT) ties to the purpose of eradicating disease (WHY), and a philosophical concept like stoicism (WHAT) connects to why people seek resilience and virtue (WHY).
MIND/SYNTAX (Cognitive Schemas & Formal Languages): This branch deals with the frameworks of knowledge and representation. Many items in WHAT are expressed through formal languages or mental models. For instance, a programming language (WHAT) has a formal syntax and grammar (MIND/SYNTAX), and mathematical objects in WHAT (like an equation or a geometric shape) are described using the language of mathematics (MIND/SYNTAX). Additionally, this is where the symbolic systems underlying concepts reside – the notations, taxonomies, or schemata that structure knowledge about a “what.” Expect cross-links such as see MIND: Logical Notation on a WHAT entry about logic.

In essence, the WHAT branch provides the content – the nouns of the knowledge world – while the other branches provide the context, actors, actions, reasons, and representations that give those nouns meaning. A WHAT item rarely exists in isolation: it was built or discovered by someone (WHO) in some context (WHERE) through some method (HOW) for some reason (WHY), and we often describe or systematize it using some language or schema (MIND/SYNTAX).

Navigating the WHAT Branch

The WHAT hierarchy is organized to be intuitive, cognitively optimized, and richly interconnected. Major ontological groupings (like Matter, Life, Technology, Ideas, Creative Works, Disciplines) form the top-level clusters. Within each, information is chunked by theme or function – breaking down into successively narrower categories (e.g. Natural World → Living Organisms → Animals → Mammals). This chunking leverages how our brains categorize information, making it easier to browse or commit to memory. Users can drill down from broad categories to very specific entries, following a tree of knowledge that can reach 4–6 levels deep (or more). For instance, under Biology (a knowledge domain) you might navigate to Genetics, then to DNA – and find a detailed breakdown of DNA’s structure and functions. A snippet of such a deep dive is included in the OPML to demonstrate how comprehensive branches will look, with placeholder notes anticipating future detail. The language in the WHAT branch aims to be accessible yet evocative. It invites you to explore connections – to see, for example, how a medieval castle in the Artifacts category might connect to feudal society in WHO/WHERE, or how the abstract concept of beauty in Concepts & Ideas relates to aesthetic philosophy in WHY and to artistic masterpieces in Arts & Media. By situating each “what” in this rich semantic web, the Arkhive encourages serendipitous discovery: you may start by looking at a simple object or idea and end up uncovering the many threads that link it to people, places, processes, purposes, and patterns of thought. In the OPML structure below, you will find the carefully modeled hierarchy for the WHAT branch, complete with example nodes and cross-references. This structured outline serves as the skeleton of the knowledge base, ready to be fleshed out with detailed content. It reflects a taxonomy that is at once mythopoetic (able to include legendary constructs), scientific (rigorously organizing factual domains), and practical (useful for real-world knowledge navigation). Enjoy exploring the WHAT of our world – both the marvels we can hold in our hands and the ideas that exist only in minds.

/// PS — Supplemental Enhancements (v 3.0.0-addendum)

• Quick-Add Skeleton  
  `Title | Domain | One-line definition | Key links:[WHO, WHERE, WHEN, WHY] | Tags:[field, era]`

• Synonym / Alias Table  
  Maintain an `aka:` list so “AI” == “Artificial Intelligence”, “VR” == “Virtual Reality”; prevents duplicate nodes and boosts fuzzy search accuracy.

• Redundancy-Check Heuristic  
  If a new WHAT candidate shares ≥ 85 % token-similarity in title + first-sentence with an existing node, auto-link as alias and flag `#what-possible-dupe`.

• Abstract–Concrete Bridge  
  For every high-level abstract concept, auto-suggest at least one concrete exemplar and vice-versa (e.g., *Gravity* ↔ *Apple falling / LIGO detection*).  Helps bidirectional navigation between theory and instance.

• Scene-DNA Hook (optional)  
  Allow a `sceneDNA` field on creative/artefact nodes to store palette / mood / BPM so Art Suite modules can inherit them.

• Auto-OPML Snapshot  
  On >15 new WHAT nodes integrated in one batch, trigger `EXPORT format="OPML" branch="WHAT"` for version control.

• Road-Map Parity  
  – Ontology diff viewer (future GPT Action)  
  – “Concept constellation” visualizer that maps dense cross-links  
  – Quick comparison command: `COMPARE WHAT:X vs Y (dimension=definition|scope|applications)`
