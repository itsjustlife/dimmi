========================================
SECTION 1: Introduction & Hierarchy Overview
========================================

1.1 Purpose and Scope of Arkhive  
The Arkhive explicitly serves as Dimmi++'s structured knowledge repository, organizing information into clearly defined hierarchical branches (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW). It supports efficient retrieval, precise categorization, and semantic linking across all integrated content.

1.2 Overview of Knowledge Branches (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW)  
Clearly defined branches for structured knowledge management:

- **WHO**: People, groups, organizations, roles.
- **WHAT**: Concepts, definitions, objects, categories.
- **WHERE**: Geographical locations, environments, resources.
- **WHEN**: Historical events, timelines, dates.
- **WHY**: Reasons, motivations, causality, significance.
- **HOW**: Processes, methods, procedures, instructions.

1.3 Explicit Integration with Arkhiver and Dimmi++  
Explicit guidelines for integration:

- Arkhive explicitly interacts with the Arkhiver pipeline for automated content categorization, integration, and semantic linking.
- Clearly referenced by Arkhiver operational files (arkhiver.txt) and cognitive logic (arkhiver-mind.txt) for accurate content structuring and retrieval.
- Explicit instructions for Dimmi++ ensure seamless navigation and interaction within the structured knowledge hierarchy.


========================================
SECTION 2: Hierarchy & Node Placement Rules
========================================

2.1 Explicit Categorization Criteria for Each Branch  
Clearly defined rules guide node placement explicitly into correct branches:
- **WHO:** Entries explicitly identify individuals, groups, or entities with agency.
- **WHAT:** Explicit definitions, objects, or concepts with descriptive characteristics.
- **WHERE:** Locations or spatial entities explicitly defined geographically or contextually.
- **WHEN:** Explicit chronological placements of historical events or time-specific nodes.
- **WHY:** Explicit nodes defining causal relationships, motivations, or significance.
- **HOW:** Explicit procedural knowledge describing methods, processes, or instructions.

2.2 Guidelines for Node Creation and Naming Conventions  
- Create nodes explicitly with clear, concise names reflecting primary content.
- Follow standardized naming formats explicitly (Proper nouns capitalized, conceptual nodes lowercase, etc.).

2.3 Hierarchical Depth and Structure Management  
- Explicitly manage node depth to maintain navigational ease (recommend ≤ 4 levels deep).
- Clearly document parent-child node relationships explicitly within metadata.

========================================
SECTION 3: Semantic Teleportation & Cross-Branch Linking Rules
========================================

3.1 Explicit Definition of Semantic Teleportation  
- Clearly define semantic teleportation as explicit semantic cross-referencing between nodes in different branches.
- Allow explicit, immediate semantic navigation across branches (e.g., WHO→WHAT, WHAT→WHY).

3.2 Cross-Linking Guidelines Between Knowledge Nodes  
- Explicitly establish meaningful semantic connections (causal, associative, hierarchical).
- Clearly document explicit cross-links within metadata for transparency and navigational ease.

3.3 Management of Redundant Nodes & Explicit Cross-References  
- Explicitly prevent node redundancy by creating semantic references rather than duplicate entries.
- Clearly mark nodes explicitly as primary or secondary (linked) to maintain explicit hierarchy clarity.

========================================
SECTION 4: Explicit Integration Instructions for Arkhiver
========================================

4.1 Procedures for Integrating New Knowledge Nodes  
- Follow explicit Arkhiver pipeline stages (DECONSTRUCT→ANALYZE→INTEGRATE→EXPAND→EXPORT) for consistent node integration.
- Explicitly document node creation steps, categorization rationale, and integration outcomes.

4.2 Guidelines for Maintaining Hierarchical Integrity  
- Explicitly verify structural coherence after integration (parent-child integrity, semantic consistency).
- Clearly maintain explicit documentation of changes and updates within metadata.

4.3 Cross-Referencing Standards to Arkhiver Operational and Cognitive Files  
- Explicitly reference arkhiver.txt for pipeline procedures and operational logic.
- Explicitly consult arkhiver-mind.txt for detailed cognitive reasoning during complex integrations.

========================================
SECTION 5: Metadata & Node Documentation Standards
========================================

5.1 Explicit Metadata Tags (ID, timestamps, semantic versioning)  
Clearly include explicit metadata tags for every node:
- **Unique ID:** Explicit UUID or similar identifier.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Clearly documented as (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- **Timestamps:** Explicitly follow ISO 8601 format for accuracy and traceability.

5.2 Documentation and Node Description Requirements  
- Explicitly provide brief, clear descriptions for each node.
- Clearly document semantic relationships and rationale for cross-links explicitly within node metadata.

5.3 Consistency and Validation Protocols for Node Entries  
- Explicitly perform consistency checks after each update to maintain integrity.
- Clearly document validation outcomes and explicitly flag any unresolved semantic inconsistencies.

========================================
SECTION 6: Hierarchy Examples & Usage Scenarios
========================================

6.1 Practical Hierarchy Examples (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, HOW)  
- Explicit WHO example: "Albert Einstein → WHAT: Theory of Relativity → WHY: Scientific Impact"
- Explicit WHAT example: "Climate Change → WHY: Human Activity → HOW: Mitigation Strategies"

6.2 Explicit Demonstrations of Cross-Branch Linking  
- Example: "WHO: Ada Lovelace" explicitly linked to "WHAT: Analytical Engine" explicitly linked to "WHY: Early Computing Innovations."

6.3 Recommended Usage Patterns and Best Practices  
- Explicitly recommend clear semantic links for intuitive navigation.
- Clearly encourage regular validation and explicit maintenance practices for robust hierarchy health.

========================================
SECTION 7: Maintenance & Updating Procedures
========================================

7.1 Guidelines for Updating and Modifying Hierarchical Structures  
- Explicitly document updates with clear semantic version increments.
- Clearly outline explicit steps for node modifications and hierarchical restructuring.

7.2 Version Control & Deprecation Policies  
- Explicitly adhere to semantic versioning for structural and content updates.
- Clearly mark deprecated nodes explicitly, documenting rationale and recommended replacements.

7.3 Validation & Consistency Check Protocols for Arkhive Updates  
- Explicitly require validation checks for each structural change.
- Clearly document consistency verification explicitly to maintain ongoing semantic integrity and hierarchical clarity.

/// PS — Supplemental Enhancements (v 3.0.0-addendum)

• Node “Scene-DNA” Tag  
  For branches dealing with creative assets (e.g., concept art timelines), allow an optional `sceneDNA` field holding palette, motif, BPM, or mood so Art-Suite modules can fetch it directly.

• Default Redundancy-Check Heuristic  
  If a new node’s title and first 120 chars of description have ≥ 85 % fuzzy match with an existing node, auto-link rather than duplicate and flag `#possible-dupe` for review.

• OPML & JSON Auto-Export  
  After every batch integration > 20 nodes, trigger an automatic OPML + JSON export snapshot to the workspace (`EXPORT format="OPML"` & `"JSON"` root).

• Live Diff Preview (future)  
  Road-map item: a “diff” view that highlights changed nodes and cross-links before final merge, preventing silent structure drift.

• Quick-Nav Synonyms  
  Maintain a lightweight synonym table (e.g., “AI” → “Artificial Intelligence”) so natural-language queries route to the correct branch without manual alias nodes.
