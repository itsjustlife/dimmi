# Philosophy and Thinking

Philosophical traditions, schools of thought, epistemology, metaphysics, critical thinking, and reasoning frameworks. Organise mindsets, argument structures, and interpretive lenses here.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Connect philosophers and thinkers through `WHO`.
- Tie intellectual movements to periods in `WHEN` and locations in `WHERE`.
- Link to `HOW` for analytical methods or dialectical practices derived from these schools.
