# Religion and Belief Systems

Faith traditions, spiritual practices, mythologies, rituals, and worldviews. Map doctrinal structures, comparative religion studies, and lived experiences within this folder.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Identify founders, leaders, and organisations in `WHO`.
- Tie sacred sites and pilgrimage routes into `WHERE`.
- Reference historical developments and reforms inside `WHEN`, and motivations in `WHY`.
