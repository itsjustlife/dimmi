# People and Self

Human identity, psychology, biographies, personal development, and interpersonal dynamics that focus on the individual perspective. Use this node for frameworks that explore what it means to be a person.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Link notable individuals to detailed `WHO` entries.
- Reference psychological theories or motivations catalogued in `WHY`.
- Tie cultural or societal contexts back to `SOCIETY` and `WHERE`.
