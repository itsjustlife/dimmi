# Human Activities

Occupations, hobbies, sports, crafts, recreation, and everyday practices. Use this branch for outlining how people spend their time, develop skills, and collaborate in practical pursuits.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Associate notable practitioners or organisations through `WHO`.
- Link to `HOW` for methods, playbooks, and workflows.
- Connect to cultural or societal motivations captured in `WHY` and `SOCIETY` notes.
