# Geography and Places

Physical and human geography, regions, countries, cities, landmarks, biomes, and spatial frameworks. Use this directory to sketch curated tours, map collections, or regional studies.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Relate important figures to `WHO` (explorers, leaders, indigenous peoples).
- Reference key events in `WHEN` that took place in these locations.
- Link to `WHY` for cultural, political, or environmental motivations tied to places.
