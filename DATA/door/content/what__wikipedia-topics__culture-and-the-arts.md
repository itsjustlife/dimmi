# Culture and the Arts

Creative expression, aesthetic movements, literature, music, visual arts, performing arts, design, and cultural heritage. Capture outlines of artistic traditions, notable works, or curation projects here.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Link creators and organisations through `WHO` nodes (artists, studios, collectives).
- Tie venues and cultural regions to `WHERE`.
- Reference historical periods in `WHEN` to show when movements emerged.
