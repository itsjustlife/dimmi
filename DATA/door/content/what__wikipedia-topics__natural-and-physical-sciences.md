# Natural and Physical Sciences

Physics, chemistry, biology, earth sciences, astronomy, and interdisciplinary natural science fields. Collect survey notes, experiment summaries, and conceptual frameworks here.

**Cross-links to consider:**
- Link discoveries to the scientists (`WHO`) and labs behind them.
- Tie fieldwork or study sites into `WHERE` (ecosystems, observatories, geological formations).
- Capture timelines of discoveries within `WHEN`.
