#### **Core Functionalities**

1. **Propose Placement in Current Arkhive**
   - **Goal**: Identify where new content best fits in the existing Arkhive.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Match content to categories using similarity scoring and contextual embeddings.
     - Suggest new subcategories if no match exists.  
   - **Outcome**: Proposed placement for user review.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "Quantum Computing in Healthcare"
     Proposal: 
     - Add to: Technology → Quantum Computing
     - Cross-reference: Healthcare → Medical Technologies
     ```

2. **Custom Arkhive Generation**
   - **Goal**: Create a standalone Arkhive for content outside the Core Arkhive’s domain.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Propose top-level and subcategories.
     - Suggest cross-references to the Core Arkhive.  
   - **Outcome**: Independent Arkhive tailored to the new content.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     New Arkhive: "Marketing Strategies"
     Categories:
     - WHO → Influencers, Marketing Experts
     - WHAT → SEO, Content Marketing
     ```

3. **View Proposed Changes**
   - **Goal**: Allow user review of suggested placements and structures.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Display proposed additions or modifications.
     - Highlight potential cross-references.  
   - **Outcome**: User-controlled approval process.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     Proposed Changes:
     - New subcategory under Technology: Quantum Computing
     - Cross-reference: Healthcare → Medical Technologies
     ```

4. **Finalize Integration**
   - **Goal**: Incorporate content after user approval.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create proposed categories or subcategories.
     - Preserve historical data and log changes.
     - Add cross-references.  
   - **Outcome**: Updated Arkhive with logical and cohesive additions.

#### **New Subcommands**

1. **INTEGRATE VALIDATE**  
   - **Purpose**: Confirm that the proposed placement aligns with Arkhive logic.  
   - **Syntax**: `INTEGRATE VALIDATE [Category/Item]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "AI Ethics"
     Validation:
     - Matches with Technology → Artificial Intelligence
     - Suggest cross-reference: Sociology → Ethical Frameworks
     ```

2. **INTEGRATE SIMPLIFY**  
   - **Purpose**: Reduce complexity by merging or streamlining categories.  
   - **Syntax**: `INTEGRATE SIMPLIFY [Category]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "Machine Learning" with subcategories "Supervised" and "Unsupervised"
     Simplified:
     - Combined under: Technology → Artificial Intelligence → Machine Learning
     ```

3. **INTEGRATE REVIEW**  
   - **Purpose**: Summarize proposed changes for clarity before final integration.  
   - **Syntax**: `INTEGRATE REVIEW [Content/Category]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Review:
     - New subcategory: Quantum Computing
     - Cross-references: Healthcare → Medical Technologies
     ```

4. **INTEGRATE ADAPT**  
   - **Purpose**: Adjust existing categories based on new content.  
   - **Syntax**: `INTEGRATE ADAPT [Category/Content]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "Blockchain in Healthcare"
     Adaptation:
     - Update Healthcare → Medical Technologies → Blockchain Applications
     ```
