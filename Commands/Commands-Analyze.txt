   - **Techniques**:
     - Sentiment Analysis (positive, neutral, negative)
     - Tone Recognition (e.g., sarcasm, frustration, excitement)  
   - **Outcome**: Sentiment and tone labels for context-sensitive actions.

6. **Logical Structure Detection**
   - **Goal**: Map arguments, identifying claims, premises, and conclusions.  
   - **Techniques**:
     - Argument Mining
     - Logical Flow Mapping  
   - **Outcome**: Argument structure with potential logical fallacies identified.

7. **Pattern Recognition**
   - **Goal**: Detect recurring themes and trends across inputs.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Trend Analysis
     - Misleading Pattern Identification
     - Historical Comparison  
   - **Outcome**: Broader understanding of input within existing patterns.
