#### **DECONSTRUCT Command**
**Default confidence_threshold:** 0.8
**Purpose**: Disassemble content into raw elements such as words, phrases, and simple ideas. Focuses on structural visibility without analysis, preparing content for further processing.

#### **Core Functionalities**

1. **Text Tokenization**
   - **Goal**: Split text into individual words, punctuation, and simple phrases.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Segment text into tokens (words, punctuation marks).
     - Identify and extract common phrases or collocations.  
   - **Outcome**: List of words and key phrases for visibility.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "AI in healthcare improves outcomes."
     Output: [AI, in, healthcare, improves, outcomes]
     Phrases: [AI in healthcare]
     ```

2. **Content Fragmentation**
   - **Goal**: Break text into smaller conceptual units (clauses, sentences, lists).  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Split sentences into clauses or ideas.
     - Decompose lists into individual items.  
   - **Outcome**: Isolated statements for granular analysis.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "AI improves efficiency and lowers costs."
     Output: ["AI improves efficiency", "lowers costs"]
     ```

3. **Separation of Concepts**
   - **Goal**: Extract core concepts, actions, and modifiers.  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Identify key nouns (concepts).
     - Extract verbs (actions) and their associated modifiers.  
   - **Outcome**: Skeleton representation of content.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     Concepts: [AI, efficiency, costs]
     Actions: [improves, lowers]
     Modifiers: [efficiency, lowers]
     ```

4. **Hierarchical Breakdown**
   - **Goal**: Display implicit content hierarchy (main ideas, supporting details).  
   - **Tasks**:
     - Isolate primary ideas from supporting specifics.
     - Map examples or explanations to their parent concepts.  
   - **Outcome**: Simplified hierarchical representation.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```
     Main Idea: "AI enhances healthcare."
     Support: "By improving diagnostics, lowering costs."
     ```

#### **New Subcommands**

1. **DECONSTRUCT LINKS**
   - **Purpose**: Break down and isolate cross-references or dependencies.  
   - **Syntax**: `DECONSTRUCT LINKS [Category/Item]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "AI links to Machine Learning and Neural Networks."
     Output:
     - Links: [AI -> Machine Learning, AI -> Neural Networks]
     ```

2. **DECONSTRUCT HIERARCHY**
   - **Purpose**: Explicitly map hierarchical relationships in content.  
   - **Syntax**: `DECONSTRUCT HIERARCHY [Content]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "Healthcare benefits from AI applications."
     Output:
     - Parent: [Healthcare]
     - Child: [AI applications]
     ```

3. **DECONSTRUCT COMPARISON**
   - **Purpose**: Break down comparisons within text.  
   - **Syntax**: `DECONSTRUCT COMPARISON [Content]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     Input: "AI is faster but less intuitive than humans."
     Output:
     - Comparison: [AI -> faster, Humans -> intuitive]
     ```

#### **Advanced Features**

1. **Minimal Analysis**
   - Focuses purely on structural disassembly, avoiding interpretation or categorization.  
   - Use Case: Preparation for deeper commands like ANALYZE or INTEGRATE.

2. **Phrase Highlighting**
   - Identifies critical multi-word expressions or terms.  
   - Example: "Machine Learning" is highlighted as a phrase.

3. **Pre-Categorization Preparation**
   - Outputs simplified components for seamless transition to other commands.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     Concepts: "Artificial Intelligence"
     Actions: "Improves"
     Categories for Placement: [Technology, Healthcare]
     ```

#### **Example Workflows**

1. **Text Disassembly**  
   ```
   Command: DECONSTRUCT "AI in healthcare transforms patient care."
   Output:
   - Tokens: [AI, in, healthcare, transforms, patient, care]
   - Phrases: [AI in healthcare, patient care]
   ```

2. **Hierarchical Analysis**  
   ```
   Command: DECONSTRUCT HIERARCHY "AI applications improve diagnostics."
   Output:
   - Parent: [AI applications]
   - Child: [improve diagnostics]
   ```

3. **Cross-Referencing**  
   ```
   Command: DECONSTRUCT LINKS "AI and robotics collaborate in manufacturing."
   Output:
   - Links: [AI -> robotics, collaborate -> manufacturing]
   ```

---

#### **Key Improvements**
- Introduced **DECONSTRUCT LINKS**, **HIERARCHY**, and **COMPARISON** for broader flexibility.  
- Enhanced functionality for hierarchical clarity and pre-categorization.  
- Added workflows for breaking down complex sentences with structural clarity.
