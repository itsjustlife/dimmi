#### **EDIT Command**
**Default confidence_threshold:** 0.8
**Purpose**: Reorganize the Arkhive by moving, merging, or copying structures to new locations, ensuring logical consistency, reducing redundancy, and maintaining cross-references.

---

#### **Core Subcommands**

1. **EDIT MOVE**  
   - **Purpose**: Relocate a structure with all its sub-items to a new location, removing it from the original place.  
   - **Syntax**: `EDIT MOVE [Source Structure] to [Destination Structure]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     EDIT MOVE "Intelligence" to "Artificial Intelligence"
     Result: "Intelligence" moved to "Artificial Intelligence" under "Technology." Removed from "MIND."
     ```

2. **EDIT MERGE**  
   - **Purpose**: Combine two structures into a unified category, consolidating sub-items and removing redundancy.  
   - **Syntax**: `EDIT MERGE [Source Structure] into [Destination Structure]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     EDIT MERGE "Artificial Intelligence" into "Machine Learning"
     Result: "Artificial Intelligence" merged with "Machine Learning." Redundant sub-items consolidated.
     ```

3. **EDIT COPY AND LINK**  
   - **Purpose**: Duplicate a structure to a new location, retaining cross-references for synchronized updates.  
   - **Syntax**: `EDIT COPY AND LINK [Source Structure] to [Destination Structure]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     EDIT COPY AND LINK "Intelligence" to "Artificial Intelligence"
     Result: "Intelligence" copied to "Artificial Intelligence." Cross-reference established. Suggested rename: "Cognitive AI Systems."
     ```

#### **New Subcommands**

4. **EDIT CLONE**  
   - **Purpose**: Create a standalone duplicate of a structure in a new location, unlinking it from the original.  
   - **Syntax**: `EDIT CLONE [Source Structure] to [Destination Structure]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     EDIT CLONE "Neural Networks" to "Advanced Computing"
     Result: Independent duplicate of "Neural Networks" created under "Advanced Computing."
     ```

5. **EDIT REMOVE LINKS**  
   - **Purpose**: Break cross-references between linked structures without deleting them.  
   - **Syntax**: `EDIT REMOVE LINKS [Linked Structures]`  
   - **Output Example**:  
     ```
     EDIT REMOVE LINKS "Intelligence" <-> "Artificial Intelligence"
     Result: Links between "Intelligence" and "Artificial Intelligence" removed. Updates are now independent.
     ```

#### **Advanced Features**

- **Contextual Adjustments**:  
  - Automatically suggests renaming or refining structures to better align with the new context.  
  - Example Adjustments:  
    ```
    Suggested Rename: "Intelligence" -> "Cognitive AI Systems" under "Artificial Intelligence."
    Add Sub-Items: "Machine Cognition," "Neural Processing."
    ```

- **Cross-Referencing for Consistency**:  
  - Ensures bidirectional updates for linked structures.  
  - Tracks unique vs. shared elements across versions with version control.

- **Redundancy Mitigation**:  
  - Identifies overlapping subcategories during MERGE operations.  
  - Suggests consolidation strategies to streamline the Arkhive.

---

#### **Usage Notes**
- Subcommands should align with specific goals: MOVE for relocation, MERGE for consolidation, COPY AND LINK for duplication with synchronization, and CLONE for independent duplication.
- Contextual adjustments ensure relevance in the destination category, while REMOVE LINKS allows customization by separating linked updates.
