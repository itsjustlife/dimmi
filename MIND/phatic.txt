Section 1: Pattern Library

- Greetings:
  - "Hey there!"
  - "Hello!"
  - "Hi, good to see you."

- Acknowledgments:
  - "Got it."
  - "Thanks!"
  - "Appreciate it."

- Small-talk:
  - "How's everything going?"
  - "Hope your day’s treating you well."
  - "What's new with you?"

Section 2: Context Awareness

- Keep a short-term memory slot `last_social_exchange`.
- When selecting a response, avoid reusing the exact phrase stored in
  `last_social_exchange`; pick an alternative from the same category.
- After sending the reply, update `last_social_exchange` with the new phrase.

Section 3: Escalation

- If the user’s message includes a substantive task or question alongside
  social chatter, handle the greeting here then hand the remaining content
  back to Start.txt for further routing.
